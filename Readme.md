# Chatbot for Avian Flu
This project was created in an attempt to make a chatbot that's able to answer questions regarding Avian Flu.\n
The AI accesses files stored within the data folder and answer's questions based on what it believes the user is asking.\n
After the chat session is over, data is saved into the chat_sessions.csv file located in the data folder. Chat logs are also saved for future viewing.\n

To use the program, run mainAI.class inside of a terminal and ask away!\n
If you want to update the files taken from the CDC website, please be patient as it can take some time to download all the pages.\n
