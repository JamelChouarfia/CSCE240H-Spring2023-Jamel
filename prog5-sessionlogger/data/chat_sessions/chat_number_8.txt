MoreAvian influenza refers to disease in birds caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. Avian influenza A viruses have been isolated from more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Wild aquatic birds include waterbirds (waterfowl) such as ducks, geese, swans, gulls, and terns, and shorebirds, such as storks, plovers, and sandpipers. Wild aquatic birds, especially dabbling ducks, are considered reservoirs (hosts) for avian influenza A viruses. Wild aquatic birds can be infected with avian influenza A viruses in their intestines and respiratory tract, but some species, such as ducks, may not get sick. However, avian influenza A viruses are very contagious among birds, and some of these viruses can sicken and even kill certain domesticated bird species, including chickens, ducks and turkeys.
Infected birds can shed avian influenza A viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Susceptible birds become infected when they have contact with the virus as it is shed by infected birds. They also can become infected through contact with surfaces that are contaminated with virus from infected birds.

Highly Pathogenic and Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza A VirusesAvian influenza A viruses are classified into the following two categories: low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses, and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A viruses. The categories refer to molecular characteristics of a virus and the virus’ ability to cause disease and mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting pdf icon[2.55 MB, 64 Pages]external icon. HPAI and LPAI are defined and explained below:

Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI): ?Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses cause either no signs of disease or mild disease in chickens/poultry (such as ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production).?Most avian influenza A viruses are?low pathogenic?and cause few signs of disease in infected wild birds.?In poultry, some low-pathogenic viruses can?mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI):? Highly pathogenic?avian influenza viruses?cause severe disease and high mortality in infected?poultry.?Only some avian influenza A(H5) and A(H7) viruses are classified as HPAI A viruses, while most A(H5) and A(H7) viruses circulating among birds are LPAI A viruses. HPAI A(H5) or A(H7) virus infections can cause disease that affects multiple internal organs with mortality up to 90% to 100%?in chickens, often within 48 hours.?However, ducks can be infected without any signs of illness. HPAI A(H5) and A(H7) virus infections in poultry?also?can spill back into wild birds, resulting in further geographic spread of the virus as those birds?migrate.?While?some?wild bird?species?can?be infected with?some HPAI A(H5) or A(H7) virus subtypes without appearing sick,?other?HPAI A(H5) and A(H7) virus subtypes can cause severe?disease and?mortality in?some?infected wild birds as well as in infected poultry.

Both HPAI and LPAI viruses can spread rapidly through poultry flocks. HPAI and LPAI designations do not refer to or correlate with the severity of illness in cases of human infection with these viruses; both LPAI and HPAI A viruses have caused mild to severe illness in infected humans. There are genetic and antigenic differences between the influenza A virus subtypes that typically infect only birds and those that can infect birds and people.

 Avian Influenza in Poultry (Domesticated Birds)
Domesticated birds (chickens, turkeys, ducks, etc.) may become infected with avian influenza A viruses through direct contact with infected waterfowl or other infected poultry, or through contact with surfaces that have been contaminated with the viruses.
Avian influenza outbreaks in domesticated birds are of concern for several reasons:

the potential for low pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) and A(H7) viruses to evolve into highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) and A(H7) viruses with major agricultural implications
the potential for rapid spread and significant illness and death among poultry during outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza
the economic impact and trade restrictions from a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak
the possibility that avian influenza A viruses could be transmitted to humans exposed to infected birds

When avian influenza A(H5) or A(H7) virus outbreaks occur in poultry, depopulation (or culling, also called “stamping out”) of infected flocks is usually carried out. In addition, surveillance of flocks that are nearby or linked to the infected flock(s) and quarantine of exposed flocks with culling if disease is detected, are the preferred control and eradication methods. See Past Outbreaks of Avian Influenza for more information about avian influenza A virus infections in U.S. poultry. More information about avian influenza in poultry in the United States is available through the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service websiteexternal icon.
Surveillance for Avian Influenza
CDC, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)external icon, the World Health Organization (WHO)external icon, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)external icon, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)external icon conduct routine surveillance to monitor influenza viruses for changes that may have implications for animal and public health. CDC and WHO surveillance efforts are focused on human health. FAO and OIE are concerned with issues affecting animals, food and agriculture.

Although avian (bird) influenza (flu) A viruses usually do not infect people, there have been some rare cases of human infection with these viruses. Illness in humans from bird flu virus infections have ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death. Asian lineage H7N9 and highly pathogenic avian influenza Asian lineage H5N1 viruses have been responsible for most human illness from bird flu viruses worldwide to date, including the most serious illnesses and illness with the highest mortality.
Infected birds shed bird flu virus through their saliva, mucous and feces. Human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or possibly when a person touches something that has virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes or nose. Human infections with bird flu viruses have occurred most often after unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with bird flu viruses. However, some infections have been identified where direct contact with infected birds or their environment was not known to have occurred.
The spread of bird flu viruses from one infected person to a close contact is very rare, and when it has happened, it has only spread to a few people. However, because of the possibility that bird flu viruses could change and gain the ability to spread easily between people, monitoring for human infection and person-to-person spread is extremely important for public health.

 Signs and Symptoms of Avian Influenza A Virus Infections in Humans
The reported signs and symptoms of bird flu virus infections in humans have ranged from no symptoms or mild illness [such as eye redness (conjunctivitis) or mild flu-like upper respiratory symptoms], to severe (such as pneumonia requiring hospitalization) and included fever (temperature of 100ºF [37.8ºC] or greater) or feeling feverish*, cough, sore throat, runny or stuff nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Less common signs and symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or seizures.
*Fever may not always be present
Detecting Bird Flu Avian Influenza A Virus Infection in Humans
Bird flu virus infection in people cannot be diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms alone; laboratory testing is needed. Bird flu virus infection is usually diagnosed by collecting a swab from the upper respiratory tract (nose or throat) of the sick person. Testing is more accurate when the swab is collected during the first few days of illness.
For critically ill patients, collection and testing of lower respiratory tract specimens also may lead to diagnosis of bird flu virus infection. However, for some patients who are no longer very sick or who have fully recovered, it may be difficult to detect bird flu virus in a specimen.
CDC has posted guidance for clinicians and public health professionals in the United States on appropriate testing, specimen collection, and processing of samples from patients who might be infected with avian influenza A viruses.

 Background and Purpose
Novel influenza A viruses are influenza A viruses that have infected people but are different from seasonal influenza A viruses that are currently circulating among humans. Novel influenza A viruses are predominantly of avian or swine origin. The clinical spectrum of human infection with avian influenza A viruses varies considerably: from asymptomatic infection to mild illness, including conjunctivitis, fever, and cough; to severe illness, including fulminant pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure resulting in death.
This document provides interim guidance for clinicians and public health professionals in the United States on appropriate specimen collection and diagnostic testing for patients who might be infected with novel influenza A viruses with the potential to cause (or are known to have caused) severe illness in people. More information about specific novel influenza A viruses, including those that have caused illness in humans, is available here.
The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) or A(H7N)  viruses in North America among wild birds or poultry might increase the likelihood of human infection with these viruses in the United States. CDC believes that the current risk to the general public’s health from avian influenza A viruses in the U.S. is low. However, because the recently detected HPAI A(H5N1) viruses are related to viruses that have caused severe disease in infected humans, they should be regarded as having the potential to cause severe disease in humans until shown otherwise. Current case definitions and recommendations for patient testing and treatment should also be consulted.
Following detection of avian influenza A viruses among US wild birds or poultry with the potential to cause severe illness in humans, CDC recommends maintaining the enhanced surveillance efforts practiced currently by state and local health departments, hospitals, and clinicians to identify people at increased risk for novel influenza A virus infection. Clinicians should notify their state health department immediately if they decide to test a patient for novel influenza A virus infection so that appropriate testing and follow up of contacts is initiated.
CDC should be notified immediately in the event that any clinical specimens from suspected patients test positive for novel influenza A virus or if the testing of clinical specimens from suspected cases are inconclusive. Human infection with a novel influenza A virus is a nationally notifiable condition.
CDC will update this guidance as additional information becomes available.
 Recommendations for Surveillance, Testing, and Investigation
Clinicians and public health personnel should consider the following for surveillance and testing:

Consider the possibility of infection with novel influenza A viruses with the potential to cause severe disease in humans in patients who present with influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms and who have had recent direct or close contact (particularly unprotected exposure, e.g., without use of respiratory protection and eye protection)1<10 days prior to illness onset to the following birds with known or suspected avian influenza A virus infection:

Domestic poultry (e.g., sick or dead chickens or turkeys)
Captive birds of prey (e.g., sick, dead, or well-appearing falcons that have had contact with wild aquatic birds)
Wild aquatic birds (e.g., sick, dead, or well-appearing ducks, geese, swans).


If infection with a novel influenza A virus with the potential to cause severe disease in humans is suspected, respiratory specimens should be collected while following recommended infection control precautions. The state health department should be notified as soon as possible, and respiratory specimens should be sent to the state health department for immediate testing (see guidance below). More information is available on Case Definitions.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus with the potential to cause severe disease in humans is suspected, state health departments are encouraged to initiate a public health investigation with animal health partners and should notify CDC promptly.

1 Exposure, especially unprotected exposure (e.g., without use of respiratory protection and eye protection) may include: direct contact with birds (e.g., handling, slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, preparation for consumption); or direct contact with surfaces contaminated with feces or bird parts (carcasses, internal organs, etc.); or prolonged close exposure to birds.
2 For questions or concerns about possible human infection in patients with exposures to birds not listed here, please contact CDC. Exposures that occur in geographic regions in the United States where newly detected HPAI A(H5) viruses have been identifiedpdf iconexternal icon are of most concern.
Infection Control when Collecting Specimens
Standard, contact, use of eye protection, and airborne precautions are recommended for management of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed novel influenza A virus infection; this includes collection of respiratory specimens. Practitioners should adhere to infection control precautions recommended for novel influenza A viruses known to cause severe disease in humans. See Interim Guidance for Infection Control Within Healthcare Settings When Caring for Confirmed Cases, Probable Cases, and Cases Under Investigation for Infection with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Disease for more information and consult CDC for specific case-by-case infection control recommendations if needed.
 When Specimens Should Be Collected
Specimens should be obtained for novel influenza A virus testing as soon as possible after illness onset, ideally within 7 days of illness onset. However, as some persons who are infected with seasonal influenza viruses are known to shed virus for longer periods (e.g., children and immunocompromised persons), specimens should be tested for novel influenza A virus even if obtained after 7 days from illness onset. Prolonged shedding of influenza viruses in the lower respiratory tract has been documented for critically ill patients with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus and avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infections. The duration of shedding of novel influenza A viruses in humans is largely unknown, and there are currently limited data describing prolonged shedding of people infected with these viruses.
 Top of Page
 Preferred Respiratory Specimens
The following respiratory specimens should be collected as soon as possible after illness onset: (i) a nasopharyngeal swab, or (ii) a nasal aspirate or wash, or (iii) two swabs combined into one viral transport media vial (e.g., a nasal or nasopharyngeal swab combined with an oropharyngeal swab). If these specimens cannot be collected, a single nasal, or oropharyngeal swab is acceptable. For patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness, a lower respiratory tract specimen (e.g., an endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) should be collected (these specimens have a higher yield for detecting HPAI A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses and may facilitate detection of other novel avian influenza A viruses). Specimens should be placed into sterile viral transport media and immediately placed on refrigerant gel-packs or at 4°C (refrigerator) for transport to the laboratory.
To increase the potential for novel influenza A virus detection, multiple respiratory specimens from different sites should be obtained from the same patient on at least two consecutive days for hospitalized patients.
 Swabs
Swab specimens should be collected using swabs with a synthetic tip (e.g., polyester or Dacron®) and an aluminum or plastic shaft. Swabs with cotton tips and wooden shafts are not recommended. Specimens collected with swabs made of calcium alginate are not acceptable. The swab specimen collection vials should contain 1-3ml of sterile viral transport medium (e.g., containing protein stabilizer, antibiotics to discourage bacterial and fungal growth, and buffer solution).
 Storing Clinical Specimens
Clinical specimens should be placed at ?-20°C (for no more than 7 days) or at ?-70°C and transported promptly. Avoid freezing and thawing specimens.
 Shipping Clinical Specimens to State Public Health Laboratories
Clinical specimens sent to state public health laboratories should be shipped in the appropriate packaging and according to instructions by the laboratory. Store frozen at ?-20°C (for no more than 7 days) or at ?-70°C and ship on dry ice. Avoid freezing and thawing specimens because viability of some viruses from specimens that were frozen and then thawed is greatly diminished. All specimens should be labeled clearly and include information requested by the local or state public health laboratory.
 Top of Page
 Diagnostic Testing
The performance of current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared diagnostic tests for detecting influenza viruses in respiratory specimens has been demonstrated for seasonal human influenza A and B viruses as described by the manufacturer’s package insert. Performance has not been demonstrated with most novel influenza A viruses. Almost all FDA-cleared influenza diagnostic tests do not specifically identify infection with avian influenza A viruses or distinguish between infection with seasonal influenza A or novel influenza A viruses. Although some diagnostic assays may detect the presence of some novel influenza A viruses, a negative result should not be used to rule out novel influenza A virus infection when testing possible human cases. Testing of symptomatic human cases of suspected novel influenza A virus infection should be referred to the nearest public health laboratory.
Existing, commercially available FDA-cleared molecular assays [e.g., Real-Time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR)] may fail to detect novel influenza A viruses or may detect with results that indicate “influenza A positive”, but with subtype not identified.  For these assays a novel influenza A virus may give an influenza A “unsubtypeable” result. Clinicians and laboratorians using molecular assays that can detect all currently circulating influenza A virus subtypes (i.e., “seasonal influenza” subtypes) who identify an unsubtypeable result should contact CDC and their state or local public health laboratory for additional testing (see below).
Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) and immunofluorescence assays are antigen detection tests that only identify whether an influenza A virus is detected and have unknown sensitivity and specificity to detect human infection with novel influenza A viruses in respiratory specimens. Some studies suggest that antigen detection tests have low sensitivity to detect HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. Therefore, negative results from either type of test do not exclude novel influenza A virus infection, especially in patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of influenza. A negative test result could be a false negative and should not be used as a final diagnostic test for influenza, including novel influenza A virus infection. These tests may yield a positive influenza A result for a specimen containing novel influenza A virus but cannot identify the subtype and cannot distinguish novel influenza A virus from seasonal influenza A virus infection. Therefore, testing by rRT-PCR is recommended at state health laboratories for any patient with suspected novel influenza A virus infection.
Clinicians should always consider diagnostic testing for other respiratory pathogens that can cause acute febrile respiratory illness depending on the local epidemiology of circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) since novel influenza A virus infections of humans are very rare, even in exposed persons.
 Testing at State Health Departments
Clinicians should notify their local and state health department immediately when they wish to test a patient for infection with novel influenza A viruses. Specimens to be tested for novel influenza A viruses should be sent first to the local or state public health laboratory.
Testing can be performed by public health laboratories on a portion of the specimen, while a portion of the sample should be reserved in case there is a need to ship it to CDC. CDC should be notified immediately in the event that any clinical specimens from suspected cases test positive for any novel influenza A virus [e.g., LPAI or HPAI A(H7N9), HPAI A(H5N1), HPAI A(H5N6) or other avian A(H5) viruses, or variant influenza A viruses2 such as A(H3v)], and clinical specimens should be shipped to CDC for confirmatory testing.
The CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Flu Diagnostic Panel (CDC Flu rRT -PCR Dx Panel) testing algorithms should be used as described in the package insert to rule out seasonal influenza A or B virus infection. Public Health officials should contact CDC immediately if they obtain unsubtypeable results when testing an influenza A virus positive specimen.
Specimens that are unsubtypeable or that test presumptive positive for novel influenza A virus at the state public health laboratory should be sent to CDC, Influenza Division, Virology Surveillance and Diagnosis Branch Laboratory for confirmatory testing. Laboratories should not attempt to isolate novel influenza A viruses using viral culture.
The following protocol may be used when testing for novel influenza A viruses with the potential to cause severe disease in humans:

All state public health laboratories should use the CDC Flu rRT-PCR Dx Panel to screen specimens for InfA, InfB, and RP. Testing for other etiologies should be considered if influenza testing is negative, based upon the local epidemiology of pathogens causing acute respiratory illness (e.g., SARS-CoV-2).
State public health laboratories should test all InfA-positive specimens with the CDC Influenza A Subtyping kit using all primer/probe sets: H3, pdmInfA and pdmH1. Detailed guidance for testing can be found in the influenza surveillance diagnostic testing algorithm disseminated recently by Association of Public Health Laboratories pdf icon[27 KB, 1 page].
For specimens collected from patients with suspected infection with HPAI A(H5) viruses), testing should be performed using the CDC H5 primer/probe set. Specimens that are positive for A(H5) virus by rRT-PCR at the state health department should be sent to CDC Influenza Division for additional testing as soon as possible.

2 Influenza A viruses that normally circulate in pigs are termed “variant viruses” when identified in infected humans.

Empiric antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible to all patients with possible infection with novel influenza A viruses with the potential to cause severe disease in humans. Antiviral treatment should not be withheld or delayed pending collection of specimens or laboratory testing. Choice of antiviral drug depends upon clinical severity. For outpatients with uncomplicated mild illness, treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor (oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, IV peramivir) or oral baloxavir can be used. For outpatients with severe, progressive, or complicated illness, or for hospitalized patients, oral oseltamivir should be administered. For information on dosing and duration of antiviral therapy, see CDC’s interim guidance on the use of antiviral medication for treatment of human infections with novel influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease.  For management of patients with laboratory-confirmed avian influenza A virus infection who are hospitalized with severe pneumonia, the CDC Influenza Division should be consulted.

What is dual use research of concern (DURC)?

What are zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern?
Flu viruses of public health concern include the following:

Novel (i.e., non-human) flu viruses of zoonotic (animal origin) that have caused past human infections. For example, Asian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)* A(H5N1) or Asian lineage A(H7N9) viruses are zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern because they have infected people and caused serious illness.
Zoonotic origin flu viruses that have not caused past human infection(s) but that may have the potential to cause human infections. For example, the HPAI A(H5) viruses identified in the United States in 2015 have not caused human infections but remain flu viruses of public health concern because of their potential to cause human illness.

A common characteristic of all zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern is that most people do not have pre-existing antibodies or immune protection against them.
*Avian influenza A viruses are designated as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) based on molecular characteristics of the virus and the ability of the virus to cause disease and mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting.
Why does CDC conduct research on zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern?
CDC conducts research on flu viruses of public health concern because most humans do not have any pre-existing immunity against them, and should these viruses gain the ability to spread efficiently among humans, they could cause a global outbreak of disease, i.e., a pandemic.
Flu viruses constantly change (see antigenic drift and shift, and sometimes these changes result in the emergence of a novel flu virus that can easily infect and spread between people. CDC Influenza Division is a World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Influenza. In this role, CDC conducts surveillance of seasonal flu viruses circulating in people to make informed decisions on the selection of viruses for use in creating seasonal flu vaccines. As part of CDC’s role as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza,  CDC also receives zoonotic viruses of public health concern that CDC characterizes and uses to create candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) that can be used to produce vaccines against viruses with pandemic potential. CDC also conducts research on zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern to learn more about these viruses. For example, CDC studies where these viruses spread, how they spread, who gets infections, and what kinds of illness they cause. This information can help scientists better understand the risk these viruses pose to humans and support development of tools and strategies for prevention and treatment.
The two flu viruses of public health concern that have caused the most human infections are both bird flu viruses: “Asian lineage avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) and Asian lineage A(H7N9) viruses. These two viruses have caused severe illness and death in humans.
 Top of Page
What is the purpose of this research?
CDC conducts laboratory research on zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern for important reasons, including but not limited to the following:

to develop candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) for use in vaccines as part of pandemic preparedness efforts;
to test to see if flu viruses of public health concern are susceptible (sensitive) or resistant to existing flu antiviral drugs, and to monitor for ongoing changes that might indicate these viruses are becoming resistant;
to develop diagnostic tests and test materials that can accurately and reliably detect human infections with specific zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern, such as Asian lineage A(H5N1) and Asian lineage A(H7N9) bird flu viruses;
to assess existing human immunity to zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern and to determine whether people’s previous vaccinations or exposures to other flu viruses provides cross-protection against these flu viruses;
to better understand properties of zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern and changes in these flu viruses (mutations) that could cause such viruses to infect people more easily, cause more severe disease, or spread in a sustained and efficient manner among people or other mammals;
to track globally where novel flu viruses are causing illness in people so that appropriate public health precautions and actions can be taken to minimize risks to the public’s health in those areas.

What research does CDC conduct on zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern?
CDC conducts laboratory tests on zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern including, but not limited to the following: antigenic characterization, antiviral resistance, genetic characterization, serology and assessment of flu viruses’ ability to cause disease and spread in animal models. See below for a more detailed explanation of each of these laboratory tests.
 Top of Page
Genetic Characterization
Genetic characterization as it applies to flu research is the study of the genes of a flu virus using a laboratory process known as “genome sequencing.” Through genome sequencing researchers can determine the order of the amino acids that form the proteins of a flu virus. Comparing the order of amino acids in one sequence to other sequences can reveal variations that might impact characteristics of the flu virus. For example, the composition of these amino acids can affect factors such as how well a virus replicates during infection, how well it transmits between hosts, its similarity or “match” to current available vaccines, and susceptibility to vaccines and its susceptibility to treatment with antiviral drugs. Flu researchers use genetic characterization to better understand these markers and to assess the risk these viruses pose to public health. Nearly all flu virus samples submitted to CDC undergo genetic sequencing as a first step in the process of studying the virus.
Antigenic Characterization
“Antigenic characterization” is the analysis of a flu virus’ surface features using antibodies. CDC researchers determine a flu virus’ antigenic (immune) properties to help assess how related different flu viruses are to each other. CDC flu laboratorians conduct antigenic characterization as part of global flu surveillance efforts to measure possible changes in circulating zoonotic flu viruses, such as bird flu viruses. If antigenic characterization shows that stockpiled vaccines no longer offer protection against newer viruses of public health concern, then health officials can decide to develop new vaccines. In some circumstances, CDC prepares candidate vaccine viruses in advance that vaccine manufacturers can use to produce a flu vaccine in the future, should it be needed. The main test used to conduct antigenic characterization is the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI test). CDC primarily conducts antigenic characterization on bird flu H5, H7, and H9 viruses, but may test other types of flu viruses that pose a potential risk to humans. More information on antigenic characterization is available on CDC’s flu antigenic characterization page.
 Top of Page
Antiviral Resistance Testing
Virus are tested to determine if they are resistant to any of the FDA-approved flu antiviral drugs. This information helps shape public health policy recommendations on the use of flu antiviral medications. CDC currently recommends use of the neuraminidase inhibitor class of antiviral drugs to prevent and treat flu illness in the United States. The neuraminidase inhibitors are drugs designed to bind to the neuraminidase protein on the surface of a flu virus to prevent the virus from replicating in the host. (More information about flu antiviral drugs is available at Treatment – Antiviral Drugs.) Antiviral resistance testing includes sequencing as well as a specific functional assay, the neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assay, to see whether virus replication is inhibited by the presence of the neuraminidase drugs.
Serology
Serology is the study of blood serum. Serum contains antibodies, which are proteins produced by the body in response to infection or vaccination. Antibodies play an essential role in protection against flu viruses. CDC’s flu serology research involves the study of antibodies in human populations to better understand whether people have any existing protection against different flu viruses. These studies can tell public health officials whether people in the study population are susceptible to infection with a particular virus or if they have existing immune protection against infection. This information is important for determining a virus’ pandemic potential or ability to spread through a population. In addition, serology is used to determine whether vaccines developed against specific flu viruses are likely to offer adequate protection and whether this protection is likely to be effective against newly emerging flu viruses.
 Top of Page
Animal testing
CDC conducts animal studies using zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern to better understand these viruses, such as how transmissible they are in mammals, their disease severity and disease characteristics, and to test the efficacy of vaccines and other pharmaceutical interventions against them.
How has CDC research helped to improve testing for zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern, such as bird flu?
CDC research has strengthened the ability of the United States and foreign countries to detect zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern. For example, in February 2006 and September 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared new CDC developed molecular laboratory tests to aid in the diagnosis of Asian A(H5N1) bird flu viruses in human respiratory specimens. CDC has since expanded its molecular test kits to detect other flu viruses, such as Asian A(H7N9) bird flu virus, which began causing human infections in China in 2013. CDC’s test kits have been made available to state public health laboratories and have been shared globally with World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating centers and international influenza testing centers.

What is “dual use research of concern (DURC)?”
Some types of flu research that are beneficial to society also fall into a category called “dual use research of concern” (DURC). DURC is defined as life sciences research that, based on current understanding, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, information, products, or technologies that could be potentially misapplied to pose a significant threat with broad potential consequences to public health and safety, agricultural crops and other plants, animals, the environment, materiel, or national security. More information about DURC is available at Dual Use Research of Concern and Bird Flu: Questions & Answers.

Avian influenza or bird flu refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. These viruses naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Bird flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with  bird flu viruses have occurred. The links below offer more information about bird flu.

Data Table

Background
Avian influenza Type A viruses (bird flu viruses) do not normally infect people, but rare cases of human infection have occurred with some bird flu viruses. Illnesses in humans from bird flu virus infections have ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness (e.g., eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms) to severe disease (e.g., pneumonia) that resulted in death. Human infections with bird flu viruses have most often occurred after close or lengthy unprotected contact (i.e., not wearing gloves or respiratory protection or eye protection) with infected birds or places that sick birds or their saliva, mucous and feces have touched.
Human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or possibly when a person touches something that has virus on it and then touches their mouth, eyes or nose. The spread of bird flu viruses from one infected person to a close contact is very rare, and when it has happened, it has not led to continued spread among people. Six main hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of bird flu viruses have infected people to cause acute respiratory illness (H3, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses). Among these, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses have caused the majority of infections in people. More information about bird flu in humans is available at Bird Flu Virus Infections in Humans.

Current U.S. Bird Flu Situation in Humans

Sporadic highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in mammals have been reported in the United States, Canada, and other countries, but the risk to the general public from these viruses remains low. More information is available at Ask the Expert: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Viruses.
The first case of an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in a person in the United States was reported on April 28, 2022. More information about this case is available.
Only four human infections with low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI)*A(H7N2) viruses resulting in mild-to-moderate illness have ever been identified in the United States.

The Current Risk to the General Public is Low

The detections of H5 viruses in wild birds, poultry, some mammals, and in one person in the United States do not change the risk to the general public’s health, which CDC considers to be low. However, outbreaks in domestic commercial and backyard poultry flocks, in addition to infections in wild birds and some mammals, might place some groups of people, who may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds, at higher risk of infection. People with job-related or recreational exposures to birds or infected mammals should take appropriate precautions to protect against bird flu.
Right now, the H5N1 bird flu situation remains primarily an animal health issue. However, CDC is watching this situation closely and taking routine preparedness and prevention measures in case this virus changes to pose a greater human health risk.
Signals that could raise the public health risk might include multiple reports of H5N1 virus infections in people from exposure to birds, or identification of spread from one infected person to a close contact.
No known human-to-human spread has occurred with the A(H5N1) virus that is currently circulating in birds in the United States and globally. Sporadic human cases of H5N1 reported with H5N1 viruses circulating in birds since 2021 have occurred following exposure to infected poultry. During past H5N1 bird flu virus outbreaks that have occurred in poultry globally, human infections were rare. Globally since 2003, countries have reported rare, sporadic human infections with H5N1 bird flu viruses to the World Health Organization (WHO). Monthly case counts are available on the WHO website.
The spread of bird flu viruses from one infected person to a close contact has occurred rarely in other countries in the past, and when it has happened, it has been limited and not sustained, and did not spread beyond close contacts.




























More Information about this H5N1 Bird Flu Virus

USDA has publicly posted the genetic sequences of several of recently detected H5N1 bird flu viruses found in U.S. wild birds and poultry. The viruses are from clade 2.3.4.4b,** which is the most common H5N1 bird flu virus worldwide at this time. Comparing information about these newer viruses to previously circulating H5N1 bird flu viruses helps inform the human health risk assessment.
CDC has been comparing the properties of current H5N1 bird flu viruses to past H5N1 bird flu viruses and has found that current H5N1 bird flu viruses detected in the U.S. during late 2021 and 2022 are different from earlier H5N1 bird flu viruses.
So far, current H5N1 bird flu viruses lack changes seen in the past that have been associated with viruses spreading easily among poultry, infecting people more easily, and causing severe illness in people.
Since December 2021, fewer than 10 human cases of H5N1 have been reported globally. Illness in humans from all bird flu virus infections has ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death. Total case counts for all human infections with H5N1 viruses reported since 1997 are available.
These cases do not change the human risk assessment to the general public, which CDC considers to be low.

About Bird Flu

Wild birds that carry bird flu viruses include waterbirds, like ducks, geese and swans, and shorebirds, like storks. Bird flu viruses can easily spread from wild birds to poultry, like chickens and turkeys. Some wild birds can carry bird flu viruses without appearing sick, but poultry, like chickens and turkeys, can get very sick and die from some bird flu viruses. If you raise backyard poultry or ducks, your birds can get bird flu if they have contact with infected wild birds or share food, sources of water, and environments with them. Most common songbirds or other birds found in the yard, like cardinals, robins, sparrows, blue jays, crows, or pigeons, do not usually carry bird flu viruses that are dangerous to poultry or people.

Human infections with bird flu viruses are rare but can occur, usually after close contact with infected birds. The current risk to the general public from bird flu viruses is low; however, it is important to remember that risk depends on exposure, and people with more exposure might have a greater risk of infection. There is existing federal guidance around bird flu exposures for different groups of people, including people with occupational or recreational exposure, such as hunters [297 KB, 2 pages] and poultry producers, and also for the general public, as well as health care providers.

Recommendations

As a general precaution, people should avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them only from a distance, if possible. Wild birds can be infected with bird flu viruses without appearing sick. If possible, avoid contact with poultry that appear ill or have died. Avoid contact with surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from wild or domestic birds, if possible. CDC has information about precautions to take with wild birds. As a reminder, it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry and poultry products in the United States. The proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165?F kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses.

CDC has guidance for specific groups of people with exposure to poultry, including poultry workers and people responding to poultry outbreaks. If you must handle wild birds or sick or dead poultry, minimize direct contact by wearing gloves and wash your hands with soap and water after touching birds. If available, wear respiratory protection such as a medical facemask. Change your clothing before contact with healthy domestic poultry and birds after handling wild birds, and discard the gloves and facemask, and then wash your hands with soap and water. Additional information is available at Information for People Exposed to Birds Infected with Avian Influenza Viruses of Public Health Concern.

What CDC is Doing

Right now, the H5N1 bird flu situation is primarily an animal health issue. The U.S. Department of Interior and USDA APHIS are the lead federal agencies for this situation. They are respectively responsible for outbreak investigation and control of bird flu in wild birds and in domestic poultry. CDC is the lead federal agency on the human health side.
Because flu viruses are constantly changing, CDC is monitoring these viruses to look for genetic changes suggesting they might spread more easily to and between people, and cause serious illness in people, or for changes that suggest reduced susceptibility to antivirals, as well as changes in the virus that might mean a new candidate vaccine virus (CVV) should be developed.
CDC has been monitoring for illness among people exposed to H5N1 virus-infected birds since these outbreaks were detected in wild birds and poultry in the United States in late 2021 and into 2022. CDC’s existing seasonal influenza surveillance systems are well equipped to rapidly detect cases of avian influenza A virus infection, including H5N1 virus, in people. Influenza virus detection assays, which can detect both seasonal and novel influenza A viruses, are used in 128 public health laboratories in all 50 U.S states and 170 laboratories globally. Additionally, there are diagnostic assays to specifically detect the current H5N1 viruses available at 99 public health laboratories in all 50 U.S. states and 129 international laboratories, representing 116 countries.
CDC, along with our state and local public health partners, also continues to actively monitor people who have been exposed to infected birds and poultry.

One human case of avian influenza A (H5N1) was reported in the United States in a person involved in culling (depopulating) of H5N1 virus-infected poultry in April 2022. This person in Colorado had no respiratory symptoms and only experienced fatigue while participating in poultry culling activities. It is possible that this case did not represent virus infection but rather detection of non-infectious H5N1 virus genetic material in a respiratory specimen following prolonged exposure to infected birds.
This one H5N1 virus-positive human case does not change the human health risk assessment for the general public, which CDC considers to be low. CDC will continue to monitor closely for signs that the risk to human health has changed. Signals that could raise the public health risk might include multiple reports of H5N1 virus infections in people following exposure to birds or identification of spread from one infected person to a close contact. CDC also is monitoring H5N1 viruses for genetic changes that have been associated with adaptation to mammals, which could indicate the virus is adapting and could spread more readily from birds to people.

H5 in Other Animals

Yes, although H5 bird flu viruses primarily infect different types of wild birds and domestic poultry, H5 bird flu viruses can infect other animals as well. Sporadic H5N1 virus infections of mammals have been reported for 20 years in different countries that have experienced H5N1 outbreaks in poultry or wild birds. H5 bird flu viruses have previously been known to occasionally infect mammals that eat (presumably infected) birds or poultry and mammals that are exposed to environments with a high concentration of virus. These mammals include, but are not limited to, wild or feral animals such as foxes; stray or domestic animals such as cats and dogs; and zoo animals such as tigers and leopards. Recently, sporadic H5 virus infections in mammals, including farmed mink in Spain; sea lions in Peru; and bears, wild foxes, and skunks, have been reported in Canada, the United States and other countries. The reports of H5 bird flu viruses in these mammals in the United States and Canada are not surprising given the widespread outbreaks of H5 bird flu in wild birds.

There is little evidence in the past of bird flu viruses spreading to people via an intermediary animal. In 2016, CDC confirmed one human infection with H7N2 bird flu virus in a person who had close, prolonged unprotected exposure to the respiratory secretions of sick cats infected with H7N2 bird flu virus at a New York City animal shelter. A second human infection with H7N2 bird flu virus was later found in someone who also had exposure to the sick, infected cats. Existing evidence suggests it is unlikely that people would be infected by H5 bird flu virus through contact with H5-virus infected wild, stray, feral, or domestic animals, but it is possible, especially with prolonged and unprotected exposure to infected animals. People who have had direct contact with infected or potentially infected sick or dead animals, including animals that might have eaten H5-virus infected birds, should monitor their health for fever and symptoms of H5 virus infection.
Signs and Symptoms may include:

Fever (Temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater) or feeling feverish/chills*
Cough
Sore throat
Difficulty breathing/Shortness of breath
Conjunctivitis (eye tearing, redness, irritation, or discharge from eye)
Headaches
Runny or stuffy nose
Muscle or body aches
Diarrhea

*Fever may not always be present
Call your state/local health department immediately if you develop any of these signs or symptoms during the 10-days after your exposure to an infected animal. Discuss your potential exposure and ask about testing for H5 virus. If testing is indicated, isolate as much as possible until test results come back and/or you have recovered from your illness. Additionally, close contacts (family members, etc.) of people who have been exposed to H5 bird flu viruses should also monitor their health for 10 days after their exposure for signs and symptoms of illness. If close contacts of people who have been exposed to H5 bird flu viruses develop signs and symptoms of illness, they should also contact their state health department.

CDC is actively looking into this situation to assess potential human health implications, including looking at H5 viruses found in these mammals to see whether these viruses have undergone any changes seen in the past that have been associated with bird flu viruses spreading easily among poultry, infecting people more easily, and causing severe illness in people. The detection of the current predominant H5 bird flu virus in mammals, including farmed mink, sea lions, bears, foxes, and skunks, does not change the human health risk assessment for the general public, which CDC considers to be low. Right now, the H5 bird flu virus situation is primarily an animal health issue. The U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are the lead federal departments for H5 virus infections in animals. In general, people should avoid wild birds and animals that appear sick or dead and also keep their pets away from sick or dead birds and animals.

No. Analyses of the H5N1 viruses from farmed mink detected in Spain have not found any indications that would point to increased ability to infect humans. H5N1 viruses do not currently have an ability to easily infect the human upper respiratory tract, which would be needed to increase the risk of transmission to people. CDC’s partner agencies have characterized the similarity of H5N1 viruses from farmed mink detected in Spain to H5N1 candidate vaccine viruses developed at CDC. These data show that vaccine viruses currently available for vaccine manufacturing are expected to provide cross-protection against viruses like the ones detected during the mink outbreak.

No. If there was mink-to-mink spread of H5N1 virus, assessment of the risk to public health would depend upon whether there were any genetic changes in the virus, and what those changes were compared with H5N1 viruses circulating in birds to date. While there was a genetic change in the H5N1 viruses detected during the outbreak in farmed mink in Spain that may have increased the amount of virus in infected mink, this change is unlikely to make it easier for H5N1 virus to transmit to humans. The genomic sequences of the H5N1 viruses isolated from mink were very similar to H5N1 viruses found in birds. Humans lack the type of receptor in the upper respiratory tract that H5N1 viruses use to cause infection. Limited mink-to-mink spread of H5N1 virus, especially in an environment with close contact among infected animals or following repeated exposure to infected birds, would not be surprising.

The wide geographic spread of H5N1 viruses in wild birds, poultry, and some other mammals could create additional opportunities for people to be exposed to these viruses, particularly through direct or close contact with infected birds. Therefore, there could be an increase in sporadic human infections resulting from poultry exposures, even if the risk of transmission of these viruses from birds to people has not increased.

CDC has developed an H5 candidate vaccine virus (CVV) that is nearly identical or, in many samples, identical to the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of recently detected clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses in birds and mammals (including the virus identified in the mink outbreak). This H5 CVV could be used to produce a vaccine for people, if needed, and would provide good protection against the currently circulating H5N1 viruses in birds.

People with avian influenza A virus infection are recommended to be treated as soon as possible with antiviral drugs that are FDA-approved for treatment of seasonal influenza. Such antiviral drugs include oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and baloxavir. Antiviral treatment works best when started as soon as symptoms begin. For patients with suspected or confirmed H5N1 virus infection who are not hospitalized, antiviral treatment with oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible. For patients who require hospitalization, antiviral treatment with oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible, and clinical management is focused on supportive care of complications, including advanced organ support in an intensive care unit for patients with severe pneumonia.

Although bird flu viruses mainly infect and spread among wild migratory water birds and domestic poultry, some bird flu viruses can infect and spread to other animals as well. Bird flu viruses have in the past been known to sometimes infect mammals that eat (presumably infected) birds or poultry, including but not limited to wild animals such as sea lions, bears, foxes, skunks; farmed mink; stray or domestic animals such cats and dogs; and zoo animals such as tigers and leopards.
While it’s unlikely that people would become infected with bird flu viruses through contact with an infected wild, stray, feral, or domestic mammal, it is possible—especially if there is prolonged and unprotected exposure to an infected animal. This page provides information for different groups of people who might have direct contact with infected or potentially infected sick or dead animals, including animals that might have eaten or been exposed to bird flu-infected birds.

Pet Owners
If your domestic animals (e.g., cats or dogs) go outside and could potentially eat or be exposed to sick or dead birds infected with bird flu viruses, or an environment contaminated with bird flu virus, they could become infected with bird flu. While it’s unlikely that you would get sick with bird flu through direct contact with your infected pet, it is possible. For example, in 2016, the spread of bird flu from a cat to a person was reported in NYC. The person who was infected [2.29 MB, 4 pages] was a veterinarian who had mild flu symptoms after prolonged exposure to sick cats without using personal protective equipment.
If your pet is showing signs of illness compatible with bird flu virus infection and has been exposed to infected (sick or dead) wild birds/poultry, you should monitor your health for signs of fever or infection.

People Who Have Had Direct Contact with Infected or Potentially Infected Animals
During outbreaks of bird flu in wild birds and/or poultry, people who have had direct contact with infected or potentially infected animals, including sick animals that might have eaten bird flu-infected birds, should monitor their health for fever and symptoms of infection.
Signs and Symptoms may include: Fever (Temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater) or feeling feverish/chills*

Cough
Sore throat
Difficulty breathing/Shortness of breath
Conjunctivitis (eye tearing, redness, irritation, or discharge from eye)
Headaches
Runny or stuffy nose
Muscle or body aches
Diarrhea

*Fever may not always be present
Call your state/local health department immediately if you develop any of these signs or symptoms during the 10-days after your exposure to an infected or potentially infected animal. Discuss your potential exposure and ask about testing. If testing is recommended, isolate as much as possible until test results come back and/or you have recovered from your illness.
Additionally, close contacts (family members, etc.) of people who have been exposed to a person or animal with lab-confirmed bird flu viruses should also monitor their health for 10 days after their exposure for signs and symptoms of illness. If close contacts of people who have been exposed to H5 bird flu viruses develop signs and symptoms of illness, they should also contact their state health department.

Influenza A viruses are endemic (can infect and regularly transmit) in 6 animal species or groups (wild waterfowl, domestic poultry, swine, horses, dogs, and bats) in addition to humans. Influenza A virus subtypes currently endemic in humans are H3N2 and H1N1 viruses. Examples of different influenza A virus subtypes currently endemic in animals include H1N1 and H3N2 in pigs (different strains than those found in humans), H3N8 in horses, H3N2 in dogs, and H5N1 in wild water birds and domestic poultry.
Influenza A viruses that typically are endemic in one animal species sometimes can cause illness in another species. For example, until 1998, only H1N1 viruses circulated widely in the U.S. pig population. However, in 1998, H3N2 viruses from humans were introduced into the pig population and caused widespread disease among pigs. More recently, H5N1 viruses from birds have caused sporadic infections in wild foxes in the U.S. and in other countries.
Avian influenza A (bird flu) viruses may be transmitted from infected birds to other animals, and potentially to humans, in two main ways:

Directly from infected birds or from avian influenza A virus-contaminated environments.
Through an intermediate host, such as another animal.

Direct infection can occur from exposure to saliva, mucous, or feces from infected birds. Bird flu infections among people are rare; however, human infections can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled. People with close or prolonged unprotected contact (not wearing respiratory and eye protection) with infected birds or places that sick birds or their mucous, saliva, or feces have contaminated, might be at greater risk of bird flu virus infection.
Infection through an intermediate host is not as straightforward or as likely to occur, although it is possible. Influenza A viruses have eight separate gene segments. The segmented genome allows influenza A viruses from different species to mix genes (reassortment) and create a new virus if influenza A viruses from two different species infect the same person or animal at the same time.
One possible way that virus reassortment could occur is if a pig were infected with a human influenza A virus and an avian influenza A virus at the same time, the new replicating viruses could reassort and produce a new influenza A virus that had some genes from the human virus and some genes from the avian virus. The resulting new virus might then be able to infect humans and spread easily from person to person, but it could have surface proteins (hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase) different than those currently found in influenza viruses that routinely circulate in humans—this could make it seem like a “new” influenza virus to people, one that had not been encountered before.
This type of major change in the influenza A viruses is known as “antigenic shift.” Antigenic shift results when a new influenza A virus subtype against which most people have little or no immune protection infects humans. If this new influenza A virus causes illness in people and is transmitted easily from person to person in a sustained manner, an influenza pandemic can occur.
While a “shift” of this kind has not occurred in relation to avian influenza viruses, such a “shift” occurred in the spring of 2009 when an H1N1 virus with genes from North American Swine, Eurasian Swine, humans and birds emerged to infect people and quickly spread, causing a pandemic. When shifts happen, most people have little or no immunity against the new virus.
It is also possible that the process of genetic reassortment could occur in a person who is co-infected with an avian influenza A virus and a human influenza A virus. The genetic information in these viruses could reassort to create a new influenza A virus with a hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase gene from the avian virus and other genes from the human virus. Influenza A viruses with a hemagglutinin against which humans have little or no immunity that have reassorted with a human influenza virus are more likely to result in sustained human-to-human transmission and have pandemic potential. Therefore, careful evaluation of influenza A viruses recovered from humans and animals that are infected with avian influenza A viruses is important to identify genetic reassortment if it occurs.
Although it is unusual for people to get influenza A virus infections directly from animals, sporadic human infections and outbreaks caused by certain avian influenza A viruses and swine influenza A viruses have been reported.

Avian influenza A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds but rarely infect people. Most previous avian influenza A virus infections of people have occurred following close, prolonged, and unprotected (e.g., no gloves or medical mask) contact with infected poultry or environments contaminated by their saliva, mucous, or feces that can contain these viruses. The risk of human infection depends, in part, on the duration of exposure and the specific exposures encountered.
Because human infection with avian influenza A virus poses pandemic potential, every case must be investigated to assess whether human-to-human transmission might have occurred. Detailed public health investigations can help determine whether person-to-person spread of an avian influenza A virus occurred. In some clusters of epidemiologically related cases of avian influenza A virus infection, limited, non-sustained, human-to-human transmission is thought to have occurred to persons without poultry exposures. No instances of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A viruses have been reported in the United States. Below are examples of probable limited, non-sustained, human-to-human transmission of different avian influenza A viruses in other countries.
Examples of probable person-to-person spread of avian influenza A viruses:

In 1997, the first human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus were identified in Hong Kong. Serologic studies suggested evidence of probable limited, non-sustained, human-to-human H5N1 virus spread.




(Buxton Bridges C. et al. “Risk of influenza A(H5N1) infection among health care workers exposed to patients with influenza A(H5N1), Hong Kong;”)
(Katz JM et al. “Antibody response in individuals infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses and detection of anti-H5 antibody among household and social contacts.”)




In 2003, in the Netherlands, there was evidence of limited, non-sustained spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N7) virus from two poultry workers to three family members. All three family members had conjunctivitis (eye inflammation) and one also had influenza-like illness after exposure to an ill poultry worker at home.

(M Du Ry van Beest Holle, Meijer, et al, 2005. “Human to Human Transmission of Avian Influenza /H7N7, The Netherlands, 2003.”)




In 2004, in Thailand, there was evidence of limited, non-sustained, person-to-person spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in family members. Spread of H5N1 virus was associated with prolonged, very close, unprotected contact between an ill child with H5N1 virus infection and her mother and aunt while the child was hospitalized.

(Ungchusak et al, 2005. “Probable Person-to-Person Transmission of Avian Influenza A(H5N1).”)




In 2005, in Indonesia, limited, non-sustained, person-to-person spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in households among family members could not be excluded among two groups of cases who had no known contact with poultry or other animals but who did have prolonged, unprotected contact with a symptomatic person with H5N1 virus infection.

(Kandun et al, 2006. “Three Indonesian Clusters of H5N1 Virus Infection in 2005.”)




In 2006, in Indonesia, limited, non-sustained, person-to-person-to-person (3rd generation) spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus may have occurred among a family cluster of eight probable or confirmed H5N1 cases.

(Avian influenza – situation in Indonesia – update 16)




In 2007, in China, limited, non-sustained, person-to-person spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus is thought to have occurred between a sick son and his father through prolonged, very close, unprotected exposure during the son’s hospitalization for severe H5N1 illness.

(Wang et al, 2008. “Probable limited person-to-person transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in China.”)




Also in 2007, in Pakistan, limited, non-sustained, person-to-person-to-person (3rd generation) spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus is thought to have occurred among brothers.

(WHO, Weekly Epidemiological Record, 2008. Human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) in North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan, October–November 2007




In 2013, human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus were first reported in China. Yearly epidemics of human infections with H7N9 viruses during 2013-2017 in China were driven mostly by contact with infected poultry at live poultry markets or in backyard poultry flocks. A small percentage of reported cases were associated with probable, limited, non-sustained, person-to-person spread, mostly occurring in households between family members. However, probable, limited, non-sustained spread of H7N9 virus between unrelated persons has been reported in a few cases in hospitals.

(Li, Q et al, 2014. “Epidemiology of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China”)
(Xiang, N et al, 2016. ”Assessing Change in Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus Infections During the Fourth Epidemic — China, September 2015–August 2016“)
(Chen et al. 2016. “Nosocomial Co-Transmission of Avian Influenza A(H7N9) and A(H1N1)pdm09 Viruses between 2 Patients with Hematologic Disorders;”)
(Fang et al, 2015. “Nosocomial transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China: epidemiological investigation.”
(Zhang et al, 2017. “A Suspected Person-to-person Transmission of Avian Influenza A (H7N9) Case in Ward.”)




Human infections with avian influenza A viruses are uncommon but have occurred sporadically in many countries, usually after unprotected exposures (e.g. not using respiratory or eye protection) to infected poultry or virus-contaminated environments and have resulted in mild-to-severe illness with a wide range of symptoms and complications. A small number of human infections with avian influenza A viruses have been attributed to exposure to infected wild birds. For some human infections, the source of the virus infection was not determined. Human infections have occurred with different subtypes of low pathogenic and highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. The designation of “low” versus “highly” pathogenic avian influenza A virus refers to specific criteria, including mortality in experimentally infected poultry, and not to the severity of illness with human infections. Clinical illness associated with human infections with avian influenza A viruses does not necessarily correlate with virus pathogenicity in infected birds.

Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza A Virus Infections*
Subtypes of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses that have been virologically confirmed to have infected people include A(H6), A(H7), A(H9), and A(H10) viruses.


LPAI A(H6N1) virus infection was reported in one person with moderate lower respiratory tract disease in Taiwan in 2013.



LPAI A(H7N2) virus infection was reported in a small number of people with conjunctivitis (pink eye), mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, or lower respiratory tract disease in the U.K. and U.S. since 2002. Four infections have been identified in the U.S. since 2002, including 2 that resulted from cat-to-human transmission of an LPAI A(H7N2) virus circulating among cats in 2016.
LPAI A(H7N3) virus infection was reported in a small number of people with conjunctivitis or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms in the U.K. and Canada since 2004.
LPAI A(H7N4) virus infection was reported in one person with pneumonia in China in 2017.
LPAI A(H7N7) virus infection was reported in one person with conjunctivitis in the U.K. in 1996.
LPAI A(H7N9) virus infection was reported in more than 1500 people in China, particularly during epidemics from 2013-2017, including cases exported to Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Canada. Clinical syndromes have included mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, lower respiratory tract disease, encephalitis, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, and multi-organ failure. The case fatality proportion in hospitalized patients is approximately 40%. A very small number of people were reported with asymptomatic infection after investigations in China during 2013. The most recent H7N9 virus infection was reported in China in 2019.



LPAI A(H9N2) virus infections have been reported sporadically in more than 100 people since 1998 in China, and in Hong Kong, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Oman, Pakistan, and Senegal. Most cases have been in children and have resulted in mild upper respiratory tract illness symptoms, but lower respiratory tract disease including severe pneumonia, and respiratory failure, including a small number of deaths, have been reported.



LPAI A(H10N3) virus infection was reported in one person with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure in China in 2021, and in another person with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure in China in 2022.
LPAI A(H10N7) virus infection was reported in a small number of people with conjunctivitis or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms in Egypt in 2004 and Australia in 2010.
LPAI A(H10N8) virus infection was reported in a small number of people with severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, including a few deaths, in China since 2013.


Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A Virus Infections*
Subtypes of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A viruses that have been virologically confirmed to have infected people include A(H5) and A(H7) viruses.


HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections have been reported in more than 880 people with approximately 50% case fatality proportion since 1997, including 20 cases and 7 deaths in Hong Kong during 1997-2003, and more than 860 cases reported in 21 countries since November 2003. Mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, lower respiratory tract disease, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, encephalitis, and multi-organ failure have been reported. One case of asymptomatic infection was reported in Vietnam in 2011, and another asymptomatic case was reported in the United Kingdom that occurred in late 2021. The spectrum of illness caused by human infection with current H5N1 bird flu viruses is unknown. Since 2016, a small number of sporadic infections have been reported each year globally. Illness in humans from all bird flu virus infections has ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death. Total case counts reported since 1997 are available.
HPAI A(H5N6) virus infections have been reported in more than 80 people in China since 2014 and one case was reported in Laos in 2021. Mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, lower respiratory tract disease, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, and multi-organ failure have been reported. Case fatality proportion in hospitalized patients is approximately 30%.
HPAI A(H5N8) virus was isolated from one asymptomatic poultry worker in Russia in 2020.



HPAI A(H7N3) virus infections have been reported in a small number of people with conjunctivitis since 2004 in Canada and in other countries.
HPAI A(H7N7) virus infections have been reported in more than 90 people, since the first human infection was identified in the U.S. in 1959; although that infection was associated with hepatitis, most infections have been associated with conjunctivitis. However, mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, lower respiratory tract disease, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, and multi-organ failure have been reported, including one death. Most reported cases were associated with exposures during widespread poultry outbreaks in the Netherlands in 2003.
HPAI A(H7N9) virus infections have been reported in China since 2016, including lower respiratory tract disease, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, and multi-organ failure. The case fatality proportion in hospitalized patients is >40%.


Human-to-Human Transmission of Avian Influenza A Viruses
Human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A viruses is rare. Probable limited, non-sustained, human-to-human transmission has been reported in a small number of people without poultry exposures who had close unprotected exposure to a symptomatic index case of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection, HPAI A(H7N7) virus infection, or LPAI A(H7N9) virus infection. Most reported cases of probable limited, non-sustained, human-to-human transmission have occurred among blood-related family members after unprotected, prolonged close household exposure to a symptomatic family member. However, a small number of reported cases occurred after unprotected, prolonged close exposure to a very sick family member in a hospital. A few cases of probable limited, non-sustained, human-to-human transmission in a hospital have been reported among unrelated patients after unprotected exposures.

There are four types of influenza (flu) viruses: A, B, C and D. Wild aquatic birds, including gulls, terns, and shorebirds, and wild waterfowl, such as ducks, geese and swans are considered reservoirs (hosts) for avian influenza A viruses.
Subtypes of Influenza A Viruses
Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes on the basis of two proteins on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 18 known HA subtypes and 11 known NA subtypes. In birds, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been identified. (Two additional subtypes, H17N10 and H18N11, have been identified in bats.) Many different combinations of HA and NA proteins are possible. For example, an “A(H7N2) virus” designates an influenza A virus subtype that has an HA 7 protein and an NA 2 protein. Similarly, an “A(H5N1)” virus has an HA 5 protein and an NA 1 protein.
All known subtypes of influenza A viruses can infect birds, except subtypes A(H17N10) and A(H18N11), which have only been found in bats. Only two influenza A virus subtypes A(H1N1)pdm09, and A(H3N2), are currently circulating among people. Influenza A viruses have been detected and are known to circulate in seven different animal species or groups, including humans, wild water birds, domestic poultry, swine, horses, dogs and bats. In many other animal species, avian influenza A viruses have been reported to cause occasional infections, but do not regularly spread among them (e.g., cats and seals). Equine (horse) influenza A(H3N8) virus routinely circulates and can cause illness in horses, and canine (dog) influenza A(H3N2) virus routinely circulates and can cause illness in dogs.
Lineages of Influenza A Viruses
Avian influenza A viruses that infect birds have evolved into distinct genetic lineages based on the geographic locations where they were first detected. These different lineages can be distinguished by studying the genetic make-up of these viruses. For example, avian influenza A viruses that were first detected in birds in Asia can be recognized as genetically different from avian influenza A viruses that were first detected among birds in North America. These broad lineage classifications can be further narrowed by genetic comparisons that allow researchers to group the most closely related viruses together. The host, time period and geographical location are often used in the lineage name to help further delineate one lineage from another.

Avian influenza A viruses rarely infect people. Five subtypes of avian influenza A viruses are known to have caused human infections (H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses). The most frequently identified subtypes of avian influenza A viruses that have caused human infections are H5, H7 and H9 viruses. Specifically, A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses have caused the majority of avian influenza A virus infections reported in people, with HPAI A(H5N6) and LPAI A(H9N2) viruses also causing human infections in recent years. Human infections with other subtypes, such as A(H6N1), A(H10N3), A(H10N7), and A(H10N8), have been detected in small numbers of people. In the United States, no HPAI A(H7) virus infections have ever been reported in people; however, there have been four laboratory-confirmed cases of LPAI A(H7N2) virus infection in people. More information about avian influenza A virus infection in humans is available at Avian Influenza A Virus Infections in Humans.
Avian Influenza A(H5) Viruses
There are nine known subtypes of A(H5) viruses [1.34 KB, 15 Pages] [A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N3), A(H5N4), A(H5N5), A(H5N6), A(H5N7), A(H5N8), and A(H5N9)]. Most A(H5) viruses identified worldwide in wild birds and poultry are LPAI, but occasionally HPAI A(H5) viruses have been detected. Sporadic A(H5) virus infections of humans have occurred, such as with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses associated with poultry outbreaks in many countries. Human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) virus have been reported in 19 countries since 2003, resulting in severe pneumonia and death in more than 50% of cases. Human infections with HPAI A(H5N6) virus have been reported since 2014 from two countries with death occurring in more than 40% of cases, and human infections with HPAI A(H5N8) virus were reported from one country in 2021.
Avian Influenza A(H6) Viruses
LPAI A(H6) virus outbreaks in birds are not internationally reportable, therefore, its true prevalence is unknown. However, LPAI A(H6) viruses have been identified in various species of wild waterfowl and domestic poultry in Eurasia and the Americas.  Known subtypes of A(H6) viruses include LPAI A(H6N1) and A(H6N2). In 2013, Taiwan reported the first known human infection with LPAI A(H6N1) virus.
Avian Influenza A(H7) Viruses
There are nine known subtypes of A(H7) viruses [1.34 KB, 15 Pages] A(H7N1), A(H7N2), A(H7N3), A(H7N4), A(H7N5), A(H7N6), A(H7N7), A(H7N8), and A(H7N9)]. Most A(H7) viruses identified worldwide in wild birds and poultry are LPAI viruses. Avian influenza A(H7) virus infection of humans have occurred sporadically. The most frequently identified A(H7) viruses associated with human infections are avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, which were first detected in China in 2013. While human infections with A(H7N9) viruses are uncommon, they have resulted in severe respiratory illness and death in approximately 40% of reported cases. In addition to A(H7N9) viruses, human infections with A(H7N2), A(H7N3), A(H7N4), and A(H7N7) viruses have been reported and have primarily caused mild to moderate illness with symptoms that included conjunctivitis and/or upper respiratory tract symptoms.
Avian Influenza A(H9) Viruses
There are nine known subtypes of A(H9) viruses [1.34 KB, 15 Pages] A(H9N1), A(H9N2), A(H9N3), A(H9N4), A(H9N5), A(H9N6), A(H9N7), A(H9N8), and A(H9N9)]; all A(H9) viruses identified worldwide in wild birds and poultry are LPAI viruses. A(H9N2) virus has been detected in bird populations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Sporadic avian influenza A(H9N2) virus infections have been reported in people with mild upper respiratory tract illness, although some infections have resulted in death.
Avian Influenza A(H10) Viruses
Known subtypes of A(H10) viruses include A(H10N3), A(H10N4), A(H10N5), A(H10N6), A(H10N7) and A(H10N8). A(H10N4) was found in a mink in 1984 and A(H10N5) was found in swine (pigs) in 2008. The A(H10) virus subtypes known to have caused human infections include A(H10N3), A(H10N7), and A(H10N8). Egypt reported the first human infections with A(H10N7) virus in 2004, while Australia reported human infections with A(H10N7) virus in March 2010. The first human infections with A(H10N8) virus were reported in China in December 2013. The first human A(H10N3) virus infection was reported in China in June 2021. Most A(H10) virus infections in people have resulted from exposure to infected poultry.

Protective actions around birds

As a general precaution, whenever possible people should avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them only from a distance.
Wild birds can be infected with avian (bird) influenza (flu) A viruses even if they don’t look sick.
Avoid unprotected contact with domestic birds (poultry) that look sick or have died.
Do not touch surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from wild or domestic birds.

The best prevention is to avoid sources of exposure
The best way to prevent avian (bird) influenza (flu) is to avoid sources of exposure whenever possible. Infected birds shed bird flu virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces. People rarely get bird flu; however, human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or when a person touches something that has virus on it and then touches their mouth, eyes or nose. Bird flu virus infections in people happen most often after close, prolonged and unprotected (no gloves or other protective wear) contact with infected birds and then the person touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.
Protective actions for people who come into contact with birds infected with bird flu because of their job
People who have job-related contact with birds should be aware of the risk of exposure to bird flu viruses and should take proper precautions. Groups of people who may have occupational exposure to infected birds include people who work at bird rehabilitation centers, people who work at bird and other animal sanctuaries, and responders to bird flu outbreaks. If you must handle sick birds because of your job, take the following precautions:

Use protective equipment like gloves, an N95 respirator if available or, if not available, a well-fitting facemask (e.g., a surgical mask), and eye protection.
Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes after contact with birds or surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from wild or domestic birds.
Wash your hands with soap and water after touching birds, and
Change your clothes before contact with healthy domestic poultry and after handling wild birds. Then, throw away the gloves and facemask, and wash your hands with soap and water.
CDC has more information available on what to do after you have been exposed to infected poultry or other birds.

These actions will help protect you against infection with bird flu viruses and will also help to prevent you from spreading bird flu to other people, birds, and animals.
CDC has information available [256 KB, 2 pages] if you have had direct contact with infected birds and you become sick.
Information for other groups who may come into contact with infected birds
Other groups of people who may have contact with birds infected with bird flu viruses include hunters and people who have backyard or hobbyist flocks. Bird owners should report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to the state or the federal government, either through their state veterinarian or by calling USDA’s toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. Find additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks on USDA’s APHIS website.
Hunters
Hunters who handle wild birds should dress game birds in the field when possible and practice good hygiene to prevent any potential disease spread. If possible, wear gloves, an N95 respirator if available or, if not available, a well-fitting facemask (e.g., a surgical mask), and eye protection when dressing birds. Afterwards, throw away the gloves and facemask and then wash your hands with soap and water. More information on general safety guidelines for hunters handling wildlife and their tissues is available from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service’s website.

Bird owners should practice good biosecurity and prevent contact between their birds and wild birds. Bird owners should follow the protective actions around birds listed at the top of this page. If you must handle sick birds, take the following precautions:

Use protective equipment like gloves, an N95 respirator if available or, if not available, a well-fitting facemask (e.g., a surgical mask), and eye protection,
Wash your hands with soap and water after touching birds,
Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes after contact with birds or surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from wild or domestic birds.
Change your clothes before contact with healthy domestic poultry and handling wild birds, captive wild birds, farmed birds, and other pet birds. Then, throw away the gloves and facemask, and wash your hands with soap and water.
CDC has more information available on what to do after you have been exposed to infected poultry or other birds.

Specific recommendations regarding the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear and how to safely put it on and take it off are available at Backyard Flock Owners: Take Steps to Protect Yourself from Avian Influenza (Bird Flu).
If you’ve had direct contact with birds infected with bird flu virus and become sick
CDC has information available [256 KB, 2 pages] for different groups of people who become sick after contact with infected birds.
People who become sick within 10 days of their exposure to infected birds should isolate at home away from their household members and should not go to work or school until they are proven not to have bird flu virus infection and have recovered from their illness. The local or state public health department should be notified and can assist in monitoring and advising when isolation is no longer required.
Close contacts (family members, etc.) of people who have been exposed to bird flu viruses should monitor their health and report to their health care provider any new symptoms, especially respiratory symptoms, within 10 days of the exposure.
For more information about bird flu and what to do if you have been exposed to bird flu, visit: What To Know About Bird Flu (cdc.gov) [154 KB, 2 Pages].
CDC also recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a seasonal flu vaccine every year.
It is especially important that people who may have exposure to sick birds get a seasonal flu vaccine, ideally 2 weeks before their potential exposure, if possible. Seasonal flu vaccination will not prevent infection with bird flu viruses but can reduce the risk of getting sick with human and bird flu viruses at the same time.
What to do if you find a dead bird
State and local governments have different policies for collecting and testing birds, so check with your state health department, state veterinary diagnostic laboratory, or state wildlife agency for information about reporting dead birds in your area. Wildlife agencies regularly investigate sick or dead bird events if large numbers are impacted. This type of reporting could help with the early detection of illnesses like West Nile virus or bird flu. If local authorities tell you to throw away the bird’s carcass (body), don’t touch it with your bare hands. Use gloves or a plastic bag turned inside out to place the body in a garbage bag, which can then be thrown away in your regular trash. To report unusual signs in birds you have seen in the wild, call 1-866-536-7593.

Preparing food
The U.S. poultry industry has strict health and safety standards, including regular monitoring for bird flu. It is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States. Properly handling and cooking poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of?165?F kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses. People should handle raw poultry hygienically and cook all poultry and poultry products (including eggs) all the way before eating. Eating uncooked or undercooked poultry can make you sick. More information is available at Chicken and Food Poisoning.
While there is no evidence that anyone has gotten bird flu after eating properly cooked poultry products, uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia. Visit USDA – Food Safety Education for instructions on handling poultry safely.
Traveling to other countries
Currently, CDC does not recommend against travel to any countries due to bird flu viruses in wild birds, poultry, or people. CDC recommends that travelers to countries and states with bird flu outbreaks in poultry or people:

Do not visit poultry farms, bird markets, or other places where live poultry are raised, kept, or sold, if possible.
Do not eat raw or undercooked poultry products and wash your hands after touching uncooked poultry.
Practice good hygiene and cleanliness.
Visit a doctor if you become sick during or after travel.

Visit CDC Travelers’ Health for more information on avian influenza.
Antiviral Drugs Can Be Used to Treat Illness
CDC currently recommends treatment as soon as possible with flu antiviral drugs for people who get sick with bird flu. Antiviral treatment works best when started as soon as symptoms begin. If you get sick after being in close contact with sick or potentially infected birds, contact your state or local health department and a health care provider right away. They may have you get tested for bird flu and a health care provider may write you a prescription for an antiviral drug to treat your illness. It’s important to take the medication as directed.
Available data on bird flu viruses spreading worldwide suggest that most bird flu virus infections can be treated with current flu antiviral drugs, if treatment is started early after symptoms begin. However, some evidence shows flu antiviral drugs may not work as well against some A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) bird flu viruses that were first detected in Asia. When flu viruses evolve in ways that make antiviral treatment less effective, this is called antiviral resistance. CDC regularly tests bird flu viruses for antiviral resistance.
The U.S. Government is Developing A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) Bird Flu Vaccines in Case they are Needed
The U.S. federal government maintains a stockpile of vaccines, including vaccines against A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) bird flu viruses. These vaccines could be used if similar viruses were to begin spreading easily from person to person. Since flu viruses change constantly, CDC continues to make candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) as needed. Creating a CVV is the first step in producing a flu vaccine. More information about Making a candidate Vaccine Virus (CVV) for a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Virus is available.

This page included resources for specific groups who may be in contact with birds/poultry, or who may be at risk for exposure to avian influenza.

If birds in your flock have avian (bird) influenza (flu) A virus infection, or you suspect they might, take the following actions to protect yourself:

Don’t touch sick or dead birds, their feces or litter, or any surface or water source (for example, ponds, waterers, buckets, pans, troughs) that might be contaminated with their saliva, feces, or any other bodily fluids without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).
Wear PPE when around sick or dead birds.
As best as possible, during depopulation and while cleaning and disinfecting contaminated premises, avoid stirring up dust, bird waste, and feathers to prevent virus from dispersing into the air.

Once bird flu infection is confirmed within a flock and premises, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) recommends that backyard owners continue to wear PPE when in contaminated areas until there are no longer infected birds, eggs, feces, or contaminated litter on the property. The recommendation to wear PPE when in contaminated areas (primary poultry housing: coops, runs, barns, etc.) depends on whether a 150-day fallow is used for virus elimination after flock depopulation.
USDA has information on cleaning and disinfecting or fallowing of premises that were contaminated with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and information on good biosecurity practices:

Checklist for Managing Poultry Manure and Litter [787 KB, 2 Pages, 11.33? × 14.67?]


Information about recommended PPE
Put on PPE before you go into the coop or poultry environment. Do not wear or store PPE in your home after it has been worn in your coop and before it has been cleaned and disinfected. Put on and take off PPE in separate clean areas, if possible.

PPE should include:

Safety goggles (unvented or indirectly vented) that fit snugly,
gloves that are disposable,
rubber boots (or waterproof boots that can be disinfected) or boot covers,
an N95 respirator if available, or, if not available, a well-fitting facemask (e.g., a surgical mask)
coveralls that are disposable and fluid-resistant,
and disposable head cover or hair cover.

You can buy these items online or at many retail, hardware, or feed stores.

When wearing PPE:

Wear well-fitting PPE,
do not touch your eyes, mouth, or nose
do not touch PPE until you are taking it off,
do not eat, drink or smoke while wearing PPE, and
only wear PPE while you are in your coop or poultry environment. Do not wear used protective gear into your home.

Removing, cleaning, and disposing of PPE:

After use, clean or throw away all PPE that was worn in your coop or poultry environment, or around your birds.


Safely remove PPE in this order:

Clean and disinfect boots,
remove boots,
remove and dispose of the coveralls,
remove and dispose of gloves,
wash hands with soap and water,
remove goggles, head cover, and respirator [ 716 KB, 1 Page, 11.33? × 14.67?],
clean and disinfect reusable goggles,
dispose respirator,
wash hands with soap and water again.



For items that need to be cleaned, clean with soap and water until visible dirt is removed, and then disinfect items with an EPA-approved disinfectant that has label claims against influenza A viruses  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Clean your clothing worn underneath PPE. Clothes should be washed using detergent. A disinfectant could be added as an additional level of caution. Clothes should then be dried on high heat. Do not wear any clothing worn when in contact with infected birds again before washing.
Shower right after removing PPE and cleaning clothing.
Self-monitor for symptoms for 10 days after the last day of exposure to potentially infected birds or contaminated materials.
If unsure, backyard flock owners should contact USDA or the State Animal Health Official to determine the date of their last exposure (the date that disposal of infected birds, eggs, manure, and litter was completed).


Public Health Monitoring Plan for USDA/APHIS Responders to Detections of Avian Influenza Virus in Poultrypdf iconexternal icon [325 KB, 17 pages]
This document provides guidance to local, state, and federal public health authorities on monitoring of persons potentially exposed to avian influenza A viruses during official United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) response activities in the United States.

You are being given this information and these instructions because you were recently around poultry or wild birds found to be infected with avian influenza viruses (“bird flu” viruses). Viruses like these have caused rare, sporadic infections in people in other countries, resulting in human illness ranging from mild (e.g., eye infections, cough, sore throat) to severe (e.g., pneumonia, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing). These viruses have the potential to cause human illness in people who have been exposed to infected birds.
Infected birds shed bird flu viruses in their saliva, mucous and feces. Human infections with bird flu viruses are rare, but they can happen when virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or possibly when a person touches something that has virus on it and then touches their mouth, eyes or nose. Most often these infections have occurred after unprotected contact with infected birds.
Because human infections with these bird flu viruses are possible, all people with direct or close exposure to infected well-appearing, sick, or dead birds, infected flocks or contaminated surfaces should be monitored for illness for 10 days after their last exposure. State and local health departments are helping to monitor people’s health and you should contact your health department if you get any of the symptoms listed on this fact sheet during the 10 days after your last exposure. By following the instructions below, you can help ensure that you receive prompt medical evaluation, testing, and appropriate treatment if you become ill with signs and symptoms that could be due to bird flu.
Please follow these instructions carefully:
1. Monitor your health for symptoms of avian influenza virus infection.

During and then immediately after your last exposure to infected birds or contaminated surfaces, monitor yourself daily for any of these signs and symptoms for 10 days:

Fever (Temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater) or feeling feverish/chills*

Cough

Sore throat

Difficulty breathing/Shortness of breath

Eye tearing, redness, or irritation

Headaches

Runny or stuffy nose

Muscle or body aches

Diarrhea

*Fever may not always be present

You should observe your health daily even if you carefully followed all guidelines and instructions for properly putting on and taking off personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintaining biosecurity precautions.
Re-start your 10-day monitoring period from Day 1 if you are around infected birds or contaminated environments again.
Your local/state health department should contact you regarding your exposure. Please follow all additional instructions that are given to you regarding monitoring for symptoms. They may, for example, ask you to respond to a daily phone call, email, or text message with a report on your health status.
2. Call your state/local health department immediately if you develop any illness signs or symptoms during the 10-day observation period.

Your health department will help you determine what to do next.
Remember:

Most of the signs and symptoms of bird flu overlap with those of other respiratory illnesses (like seasonal flu or COVID-19). Fever may not always be present.
If you develop any of the signs or symptoms listed on this fact sheet, immediately call the health department of the state you are in at the time. Your health department wants to hear from you, even if it turns out to be a ‘false alarm’. Your health department will give you further instructions and might ask you to get tested for bird flu virus infection.
If you have symptoms, stay home and limit contact with others as much as possible until the results of your test are known. Your health department might have additional instructions for you as well.
To test for bird flu virus, a doctor or nurse will collect a sample from you by swabbing your nose and/or throat.
If you become sick while you are observing your health, a doctor might prescribe an antiviral medication for you that is used for treatment of seasonal influenza. These drugs can also treat bird flu virus infection. It is important to start antiviral treatment as soon as possible and to follow the directions for taking all of the medication that is prescribed. (CDC recommends that clinicians prescribe antiviral medications for treatment of ill persons who had exposure to bird flu viruses and are suspected to be infected with bird flu viruses.)

Bird flu virus infections in humans are of public health concern, not only because of the illness they may cause, but because of their pandemic potential if they were to change to spread easily from person-to-person. Bird flu virus infections can cause a wide range of illness, from mild to severe. Some bird flu viruses have been associated with greater numbers of human infections and more serious illnesses in people and therefore may pose a greater public health risk.

To reduce their risk of infection with avian influenza A viruses associated with severe disease, poultry workers and responders should do all of the following:

Avoid unprotected direct physical contact with sick birds.
Avoid unprotected direct physical contact with any of the following that are associated with sick birds: poultry carcasses, poultry feces or litter, surfaces and water that might be contaminated with poultry excretions (e.g., ponds, waterers, buckets, pans, troughs).
Wear recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when in direct contact with birds that are potentially infected with avian influenza A viruses, including poultry carcasses, poultry feces or litter, or when going into any buildings with sick or dead poultry, or carcasses, feces, or litter from poultry.
Put on and take off PPE in separate clean areas;
Recommended PPE includes: properly-fitted unvented or indirectly vented safety goggles, disposable gloves, boots or boot covers, a NIOSH-approved respirator (e.g., N95), and disposable fluid-resistant[1]coveralls, and disposable head cover or hair cover.
NIOSH-approved air-purifying respirators with a particulate filter that is rated N95 or higher are recommended for workers who have contact with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) or A(H7) virus-infected birds, carcasses or potentially virus-contaminated materials. Respirator use should be in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134) and other requirements. Staff that will need to wear respirators must be medically-cleared, trained, and fit-tested for respirator use. Detailed information on respiratory protection programs, including fit testing procedures, can be accessed at OSHA’s Respiratory Protection eToolexternal icon. PPE training topics should include all of the following:

Proper fit-testing, wearing and use of respirators;
Safe removal of respirators;
Safe disposal of disposable respirators or cleaning and disinfection of reusable respirators;
Medical contraindications to respirator use.


Reusable PPE (e.g., rubber boots, rubber apron) should be:

Cleaned until visible dirt is removed, and then
Disinfected with an EPA-approved disinfectant that has label claims against influenza A viruses according to the manufacturer’s instructions.



All PPE should be used in accordance with OSHA regulations found at 29 CFR 1910 Subpart I (Personal Protective Equipment). Workers must receive training on and demonstrate an understanding of when to use PPE; what PPE is necessary; how to properly put on, use, take off, properly dispose of, and maintain PPE; and the limitations of PPE.

Avoid touching the eyes, mouth, and nose after touching any contaminated material while wearing PPE.
Do not eat, drink, smoke, or use the bathroom while wearing PPE.
Safely remove PPE in sequence:

Remove and dispose of the apron, if worn;
Clean and disinfect boots;
Remove boots;
Remove and dispose of the coveralls;
Remove and dispose of gloves;
Wash hands with soap and water;
Remove goggles and respirator;
Clean and disinfect reusable goggles and respirator;
Wash hands with soap and water again.


Perform good hand hygiene such as handwashing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand rub after removing PPE if soap and water are not immediately available.
Shower at the end of the work shift and leave all contaminated clothing and equipment at work. Never wear contaminated clothing or equipment outside the work area.
Self-monitor for symptoms of illness for 10 days after the last day of exposure to potentially infected poultry or contaminated materials.

Public Health Monitoring Plan for USDA/APHIS Responders to Detections of Avian Influenza Virus in Poultry pdf icon[325 KB, 17 pages]external icon
This document provides guidance to local, state, and federal public health authorities on monitoring of persons potentially exposed to avian influenza viruses during official United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) response activities in the United States.

print solid iconPrint
You are being given this information and these instructions because you are participating or participated in responding to poultry outbreaks of bird flu and were potentially exposed to bird flu viruses. 
As part of your work, you may have been around bird flu viruses. Infected birds shed bird flu viruses in their saliva, mucous and feces. Human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or when a person touches something that has virus on it and then touches their mouth, eyes or nose. Rare human infections with some bird flu viruses have occurred most often after unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with these viruses. However, some infections have also been identified when direct contact was not known to have occurred. Human infections with bird flu viruses worldwide have resulted in a wide range of illness, from asymptomatic infection (no symptoms) to mild illness (eye infections, upper respiratory symptoms), to severe pneumonia resulting in death.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believes the risk of infection with bird flu viruses is low. However, because human infections with these bid flu viruses are possible, all people participating in bird flu outbreak response efforts should be monitored for illness during their duty and for 10 days after their last possible exposure to infected birds or potentially contaminated environments, even if exposure to the sick birds was minimal or if personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn appropriately. During your response efforts, please follow all instructions given to you by your safety officer. After your response effort has concluded, you (and your resident state/local health department) will be responsible for illness monitoring.
State and local health departments are helping with this monitoring effort and should contact you while you’re observing your health. By following the instructions below, you can help ensure that you receive prompt medical evaluation, testing (if warranted), and appropriate treatment if you become ill with signs and symptoms that could be due to infection with bird flu viruses.
Thank you for your contribution to the bird flu domestic response effort.
Please follow these instructions carefully:

 During your response efforts and for the 10-day monitoring period, your state/local public health department officials should contact you regularly by phone, text, or email to verify that you are healthy. 
 In addition to check-ins from your state/local public health department, self-monitor your health for symptoms of bird flu virus infection. During and then immediately after your last exposure to infected birds or contaminated surfaces, take your temperature and monitor yourself daily for any of these signs and symptoms for 10 days:




Fever (Temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater) or feeling feverish/chills*
Cough
Sore throat
Difficulty breathing/Shortness of breath
Eye tearing, redness, or irritation
Headaches
Runny or stuffy nose
Muscle or body aches
Diarrhea

*Fever may not always be present


You should observe your health daily even if you carefully followed all guidelines and instructions for properly putting on and taking off personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintaining biosecurity precautions.
Re-start your 10-day monitoring period from Day 1 if you are around sick or dead birds again.


 If you have any of the above signs or symptoms at any time during your deployment, contact your Safety Officer immediately.

If you are unable to contact your Safety Officer and need to seek medical attention, please give your resident state/local Public Health Department contact information to your physician and tell them you are an incident responder for the avian influenza virus outbreak in that state.


 If you have any of the above signs or symptoms at any time during the 10 days after your demobilization, please contact your resident state/local public health department immediately. The state/local public health department will advise you on what steps to take next be tested for an infection.


 If you have any of the above signs or symptoms at any time during the 10 days after your demobilization, please stay home and avoid contact with others as much as possible until you speak with your state/local public health department or health care provider.

Remember:

Many of the signs and symptoms of bird flu overlap with those of other respiratory illnesses (like seasonal flu).
If you develop any of the signs or symptoms listed in this fact sheet during your response efforts, contact your Safety Officer. If you cannot get in touch with your Safety Officer or develop any of the signs or symptoms listed above in the 10 days following your response efforts, call your resident health department immediately. Your health department wants to hear from you, even if it turns out to be a ‘false alarm’.
Your health department should contact you by phone, email, or text during your response efforts and while you are observing your health afterward.
If you have symptoms, your health department will give you instructions and ask you to get tested for bird flu virus infection.
If you have symptoms, stay home and limit contact with others as much as possible until the results of your test are known. Your health department may have additional instructions for you as well.
To test for bird flu virus infection, a doctor or nurse will collect a sample from you by swabbing your nose and/or throat.
If you become sick while you are observing your health after demobilization, a health care provider may prescribe you an antiviral medication that is used for treatment of flu. It’s important to take the medication as prescribed. (CDC recommends that clinicians prescribe antiviral medications for treatment of ill people who had exposure to bird flu viruses.)

Bird flu virus infections in humans are of public health concern, not only because of the illness they may cause, but because of their pandemic potential. Some bird flu viruses have been associated with greater numbers of human infections and more serious illnesses in people and therefore may pose a higher public health risk.
Bird flu viruses of public health concern include:

Bird flu viruses that have caused severe and fatal disease in humans, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses and low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H7N9) virus.
Bird flu viruses that are related to viruses that have caused severe disease in humans because of their perceived potential to also cause severe disease in people. These include avian influenza viruses recently detected in birds in the United States.
Other bird flu viruses may be deemed to be of public health concern based on specific circumstances.

This page provides a brief background, timeline, and summary of significant past outbreaks of bird flu in wild birds, domestic poultry, and people. 

Flu A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 18 different HA subtypes (H1 through H18) and 11 different NA subtypes (N1 through N11).
More
Background
The first description of avian influenza (bird flu) dates to 1878 in northern Italy, when it was described as a contagious disease of poultry associated with high mortality, referred to as “fowl plague.” At the turn of the 20th century, it was determined that “fowl plague” was caused by a virus; however, it was not until 1955 that the virus was shown to be a type A influenza virus. In 1971, influenza viruses were first classified based on the antigenic properties of their structural and surface proteins: the nucleoprotein (NP) [type] and hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [subtype] proteins, as well as the species of origin. By 1980, researchers were using this system to classify influenza viruses regardless of the species of origin. This naming tradition is still used today. By 1981, the term “fowl plague” was substituted by the more appropriate term, avian influenza, at the First International Symposium on Avian Influenza.

Flu virus surface proteins (HA and NA) can change in two ways. These changes are referred to as antigenic drift and shift. Flu viruses change all the time due to antigenic drift, but antigenic shift happens less frequently.
More
Avian influenza A viruses are further classified into two categories: highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses based on specific criteria (viral characteristics and mortality in experimentally infected chickens1). Most bird flu viruses are?low pathogenic?and cause few or no signs of disease in infected wild birds. LPAI viruses also cause either no signs of disease or mild disease in chickens and other domestic poultry. In contrast, HPAI viruses can cause severe disease and high mortality in infected poultry yet cause little to no disease signs in certain wild aquatic bird species. While classification as an LPAI or HPAI virus refers to the severity of disease in infected poultry, both kinds of avian influenza A viruses have caused severe disease in infected humans.

1880s – 1950s
The below timeline gives a summary of significant HPAI and LPAI outbreaks in birds, infections in people, and events from 1880-1959.

Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1880s
							
In 1878, the term “fowl plague” was used to describe the poultry disease observed in Italy and other European countries. “Fowl plague” was then differentiated from fowl cholera in 1880. Though these are the oldest bird flu references date, it is believed that prior to these references the disease had already been in existence for a long time, perhaps for hundreds of years2.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1894
							
There are reports of subsequent outbreaks in poultry of HPAI in 1894 and 1901 in Italy, which spread with the poultry stock of an itinerary poultry merchant to eastern Austria and Germany and later to Belgium and France3,4.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1901
							
The cause (etiology) of HPAI in domestic poultry was identified as a virus, though Influenza viruses were not isolated until the 1930s.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1918
							
The ‘Spanish’ influenza H1N1 pandemic of 1918-1919 killed an estimated 50-100 million people worldwide5. Although the virus was not isolated during 1918-1919, when the technology was available the genetic sequence was later determined to be an avian-like H1N1 virus.
Influenza A viruses cause seasonal epidemics of human flu worldwide and, much more rarely, flu pandemics. Flu pandemics are typically caused by the introduction and spread of an animal (avian, swine, or combination) influenza A virus with an HA subtype that is new (novel) to human populations6.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1924
							
The first outbreak of HPAI in poultry in the United States occurred during the fall and winter of 1924–19257. The disease first appeared to have caused severe losses in live bird markets in New York City.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1950s
							
By the mid-1900s, HPAI had been reported in poultry in most of Europe, Russia, North America, South America, Middle East, Africa and Asia8,9.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1957
							
In February 1957, a new influenza A(H2N2) virus emerged in people in East Asia, triggering a pandemic (“Asian Flu”). This H2N2 virus was comprised of three different genes from an H2N2 virus that originated from an avian influenza A virus, including the H2 hemagglutinin and the N2 neuraminidase genes, and genes from the human seasonal H1N1 virus10. The estimated number of deaths was 1.1 million worldwide and 116,000 in the United States6.

							1960s
							
During the 1960s several LPAI viruses of different subtypes were isolated from turkeys, chickens, ducks, quail, pheasants and partridges with respiratory and reproductive disease, providing new light into the great variation existing among influenza A viruses11,12. But the natural wild reservoir of these viruses still had not been identified.

							1961
							
An outbreak in wild birds (common tern) in South Africa suggests wild birds as a possible reservoir for avian influenza A viruses.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1967
							
Researchers proposed a relationship between human and avian influenza A viruses after a study showed a relationship between the 1957 human pandemic influenza virus and an influenza A virus isolated from a turkey. The study raised the question, and triggered additional studies, on whether human influenza viruses are of avian origin.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1968
							
The 1968 pandemic was caused by an influenza A (H3N2) virus comprised of two genes from an avian influenza A virus, including a new H3 hemagglutinin, but also contained the N2 neuraminidase from the 1957 H2N2 virus. In addition, the 1968 H3N2 pandemic virus was a reassortant virus between the seasonal human influenza A(H2N2) virus and a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus10. It was first detected in Hong Kong in July, and noted in the United States by September 196813,14,15. The estimated number of deaths was 1 million worldwide and about 100,000 in the United States.


Though indications on the potential role of bird flu on the origin of human pandemics had been present for nearly a decade, it wasn’t until 1968 that avian influenza A virus infections in wild birds in the United States, Australia, and Russia were confirmed using blood tests16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

							1983
							
In April 1983, an LPAI H5N2 virus circulated in chickens in the United States. Later that year, this virus had evolved into a highly pathogenic strain causing high mortality in affected flocks21.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1994
							
In May 1994, a LPAI H5N2 virus was detected in chickens in Mexico22.
Also in 1994, an outbreak of HPAI H7N3 virus occurred in poultry farms in Pakistan23. In 2001, 2003 and 2004, viruses of low and high pathogenicity continued to emerge in birds.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1996
							
HPAI H5N1 virus first identified in farmed waterfowl (geese) in Southern China in 199624.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1997
							
In 1997, large HPAI H5N1 virus outbreaks were detected in poultry in Hong Kong, and zoonotic (animal to human) transmission led to 18 human infections with six deaths. These were the recognized first H5N1 human infections with fatal outcomes5.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							1999
							
In March 1999, a LPAI H7N1 virus was isolated from chickens in Italy25, 26, 27.

2000s
The below timeline gives a summary of significant HPAI and LPAI outbreaks in birds, infections in people, and events from 2000-2009.

Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2002
							
Although there are reports of HPAI virus outbreaks in South America during the early 1900s, it was not until 2002 that the first HPAI bird flu virus was detected on this continent. In May 2002, an LPAI H7N3 virus was isolated from commerical poultry in Chile. In June, an HPAI virus of the same subtype was obtained from the same flock28.
Also in 2002, one human case of LPAI H7N2 virus infection was identified in the United States29, 30.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2003
							
February 2003, HPAI H7N7 virus caused outbreaks in layer farms in the Netherlands, affecting around 28% of the total national chicken population. This outbreak in poultry was also associated with 89 human cases, 1 of which with fatal outcomes5,31.
In December 2003, HPAI H5N1 viruses re-emerged in Asia in wild birds, causing outbreaks in poultry and two fatal human infections in Hong Kong32,33,34.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2004
							
Between February and May 2004, an outbreak of bird flu due to an H7N3 virus occurred among poultry in Canada. Within days, the virus causing this outbreak had changed from low to high pathogenicity. There were two human cases identified, both with very mild illness35, 36: One case was infected with a LPAI virus, and one case was infected with a HPAI H7N3 virus37, 38.
Additionally, another human case of HPAI H7N2 virus infection was identified, but findings were not published until 201239, 40.
Reports of detections in poultry followed from Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Indonesia, China, Malaysia from January-August 2004 with sporadic human infections of varying severity reported41.


In 2004, the United States experienced a poultry outbreak of a North American lineage HPAI H5N2 virus that was restricted to one farm.
This outbreak was reported in a flock of 7,000 chickens and was the first outbreak of HPAI virus in the United States in 20 years42.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2005
							
From 2003-2005, wild birds spread HPAI H5N1 virus to poultry in Africa, the Middle East and Europe, and the HPAI H5N1 virus’s HA surface protein diversified into numerous clades (related groups), and viruses reassorted into multiple genetic lineages (genotypes) that were detected around the world5,41.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2009
							
In the spring of 2009, a novel influenza A H1N1 virus emerged in humans. It was detected first in the United States and spread quickly across the United States and the world. This new H1N1 virus contained a unique combination of swine, avian and human influenza genes not previously identified in animals or people. This virus was designated as influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus10.

2010s
The below timeline gives a summary of significant HPAI and LPAI outbreaks in birds, infections in people, and events from 2010-2019.

Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2010s
							
During the 2010s, multiple HPAI H5 viruses were identified with new NA subtypes (e.g., H5N2, H5N3, H5N6,?H5N8?and H5N9) following reassortment (gene swapping) with wild bird lineages among wild birds and/or domestic poultry24.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2011
							
By 2011, United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization considered six countries to be enzootic (regularly affecting animals) for HPAI H5N1 virus in poultry: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam.
Sporadic outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 virus also occurred among poultry in non-enzootic countries5,24.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2013
							
In March 2013, human infections with LPAI H7N9 virus were reported?in China. These detections were linked to LPAI H7N9 virus in poultry in live poultry markets5.
While LPAI H7N9 virus infection does not generally cause observable illness in poultry43, these viruses caused severe illness and death in people44.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2014
							
HPAI H5N6 and H5N8 viruses emerged during 201424.
Reassortment (gene-swapping) of H5 viruses with wild bird lineages led to the emergence and detection of H5N6 and H5N8 virus subtypes belonging to clade 2.3.4.4 in 12 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Of note, the H5N6 viruses had a poultry-adapted NA.
H5 viruses with various NA genes continue to be detected, including in US wild birds and domestic poultry.
In January 2014, the first human infection with Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 virus in the Americas was reported in Canada in a traveler returning from China.
Also in January 2014, the Malaysian Ministry of Health reported a human infection with LPAI H7N9 virus. The case occurred in a traveler from China who had developed symptoms before traveling. This was the first case of H7N9 detected outside of China.
In December 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reported ? HPAI H5N2 and H5N8 viruses in US wild birds ?in several states.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2015
							
In January 2015, an HPAI H5N1 virus was identified in a sample taken from a US wild bird in 2014. This virus resulted from reassortment of the Asian lineage H5 viruses with an N1 NA from North American wild birds. No human infections with this reassortant HPAI H5N1 virus were reported.
Also in January 2015, the first two human infections with Asian lineage LPAI H7N9 virus in North America were reported in travelers who became ill after a trip to China45.


From January to June 2015, HPAI H5 virus outbreaks (including H5N2 and H5N8 viruses) were reported in commercial poultry flocks in 21 US states and in Canada.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2016
							
In January 2016, an outbreak of North American lineage HPAI H7N8 virus was detected in a commercial poultry flock in the United States, and subsequently North American lineage LPAI H7N8 was detected in eight additional nearby turkey flocks.
In December 2016, two human infections with a North American lineage LPAI H7N2 virus were reported in the United States. These people experienced mild upper respiratory tract illness following unprotected exposure to infected cats at an animal shelter experiencing an outbreak of LPAI H7N2 in cats.
Avian influenza HPAI H5N8 virus was detected in two seals stranded on the Baltic coast of Poland in 2016 and 201757.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2017
							
In late 2016 and early 2017, there were outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 virus in domestic poultry and wild birds in Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa.
In early 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported human infections with Asian lineage H7N9 bird flu. It is thought that during these outbreaks in poultry some LPAI H7N9 virus strains mutated to become HPAI H7N9 viruses because markers for HPAI viruses were found in the second wave of infections, though the majority of confirmed H7N9 human cases reported were LPAI H7N9.
With nearly 700 infections reported, this was the largest epidemic of Asian lineage H7N9 human infections in China since 2013.


In March 2017, an outbreak of HPAI H7N9 virus was detected in two commercial chicken breeder flocks in the United States46. This North American lineage HPAI H7N9 virus was genetically unrelated to the Asian lineage HPAI H7N9 viruses reported in China and was not believed to pose the same risk to public health.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2018
							
During 2018, HPAI H5N6 and H5N8 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b become the predominant type of bird flu circulating among birds in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Europe24.


						
					
				Timelineicon
					
						
						
							2019
							
As of May 2019, 861 human cases of H5N1 virus infection and 455 deaths had been reported from 17 countries since November 2003.
Also as of May 2019, 1,568 lab confirmed H7N9 human cases had occurred since 2013, with 612 deaths47.

Around the world and in North America, avian influenza A outbreaks occur in poultry from time to time. Outbreaks of some avian influenza A viruses in poultry have been associated with illness and death in people in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East. While very rare, some avian influenza A viruses have also caused illness in people in North America.

This graph shows all human infections with HPAI H5N1 bird flu virus reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), since the first human cases in 1997.
H5N1 bird flu viruses first emerged in southern China in 1996. Those viruses caused large poultry outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997, which resulted in 18 human infections. The 1997 bird outbreak was controlled, but the H5N1 bird flu viruses were not eradicated in birds and re-surfaced in 2003 to spread widely in birds throughout Asia, and later in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, causing poultry outbreaks and sporadic human infections. Since 2003, more than 20 countries have reported more than 860 human infections with H5N1 bird flu viruses to WHO.
H5N1 bird flu viruses that are currently circulating in wild birds and poultry in much of the world are genetically different from earlier versions of the virus and emerged to become the predominant subtype of HPAI H5 in the fall of 2021. These viruses have caused sporadic poultry infections and poultry outbreaks in many countries, most recently the United States. In contrast to previous H5N1 viruses, which still circulate to a lesser extent in several countries, at this time, fewer than 10 cases with current H5N1 bird flu viruses have been reported globally. However, illness in humans from all bird flu virus infections has ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death.

This guidance provides recommendations for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings for patients who may be infected with a novel influenza A virus (i.e., an influenza A virus of animal origin that has not recently been circulating among humans) associated with severe disease. The prevention measures outlined in this guidance will help prevent transmission to health care personnel, other patients, and visitors. Patients who may be infected with novel influenza A viruses include confirmed cases, probable cases, and suspect cases/cases under investigation for infection with a novel influenza A virus associated with severe disease. Information about novel influenza A viruses that have caused illness in humans is available here.
These recommendations will be updated as additional information on transmissibility, epidemiology, available treatment, or vaccine options for novel influenza A viruses becomes available. 
Interim Guidance Background
These interim recommendations are based upon current available information and assume the following:

Lack of an available safe and effective vaccine against novel influenza A viruses associated with severe disease in infected humans [e.g., avian influenza A(H5) or A(H7) viruses]
Concern for increased morbidity and mortality among infected patients
Few or no confirmed cases in the United States

This interim guidance recommends a level of infection prevention and control measures for patients with suspected or confirmed novel influenza A virus infection that is different from that recommended for patients with seasonal influenza, as outlined in the Prevention Strategies for Seasonal Influenza in Healthcare Settings. Among important differences from seasonal influenza guidance are recommendations for Contact and Airborne Precautions.
Note that recommendations in this guidance are in addition to Standard Precautions. Information on Standard Precautions (can be found in the following documents:

Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings
Core Infection Prevention and Control Practices for Safe Healthcare Delivery in All Settings – Recommendations of the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committeepdf icon

This interim guidance was developed based on existing infection prevention and control guidelines, currently available scientific evidence, and expert opinion.
Definition of Healthcare Settings — Refers to places where healthcare is delivered. Healthcare settings include but are not limited to acute-care hospitals; long-term acute care facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities; physicians’ offices; urgent-care centers; outpatient clinics; home healthcare (i.e., care provided at home by professional healthcare providers), and vehicles where healthcare is delivered (e.g., mobile clinics). They also include specific sites within non-healthcare settings where healthcare is routinely delivered (e.g., a medical clinic embedded within a workplace or school).
Definition of Healthcare Personnel (HCP) – HCP refers to all paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials, including body substances (e.g., blood, tissue, and specific body fluids); contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment; contaminated environmental surfaces; or contaminated air. These HCP include, but are not limited to, emergency medical service personnel, nurses, nursing assistants, physicians, technicians, therapists, phlebotomists, pharmacists, students and trainees, contractual staff not employed by the healthcare facility, and persons not directly involved in patient care, but who could be exposed to infectious agents that can be transmitted in the healthcare setting (e.g., clerical, dietary, environmental services, laundry, security, engineering and facilities management, administrative, billing, and volunteer personnel).
Information and Definitions of Facemask and Respirator available in the Appendix on this page.

Fundamental Elements to Prevent Transmission

		
			
			Minimize Potential Exposures
		
	
	
		Implement policies and practices to minimize exposures before arrival, upon arrival, and throughout the duration of the affected patient’s presence in the healthcare setting. Measures include prompt screening and triage of symptomatic patients, implementation of respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, placement of a facemask (See definition of facemask in Appendix) on symptomatic patients upon entry to the facility, placement in a single-patient airborne infection isolation room (or if unavailable, a single room with door closed pending transfer), and rapid implementation of Airborne and Contact Precautions with the use of eye protection, in additional to Standard Precautions. Use of source control for exposed but asymptomatic patients (e.g., household contacts) can also be considered. For more information on ways to minimize potential exposures, please see Prevention Strategies for Seasonal Influenza in Healthcare Settings.

	
		
			
			Implement Engineering Controls
		
	
	
		Consider designing and installing engineering controls to reduce or eliminate exposures by shielding HCP and other patients from infected individuals. Examples of engineering controls include installing physical barriers such as partitions in triage areas or curtains that are drawn between patients in shared areas. Engineering controls may also be important to reduce exposures related to specific procedures such as using closed suctioning systems for airways suction in intubated patients. Another important engineering control is ensuring that appropriate air-handling systems (with appropriate directionality, filtration, exchange rate, etc.) are installed and maintained in healthcare facilities.

	
		
			
			Monitor and Manage Ill and Exposed Healthcare Personnel
		
	
	
		
HCP who are potentially exposed to patients covered by this guidance should be advised to report any signs or symptoms of acute illness to their supervisor for a period of 10 days after the last known contact with the sick patient.

Facilities should consider dedicating HCP caring for these patients to minimize risk of transmission and exposure to other patients and other HCP.
Facilities should keep track of all HCP (e.g., clinicians, environmental services workers, food service) who care for or enter the rooms of these patients.


HCP who develop any respiratory symptoms after any contact with patients covered by this guidance should not report for work. These HCP should






notify occupational health services, their supervisor, or other appropriate individual about their symptoms,
isolate themselves at home,
implement respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette (e.g., wear a facemask),
seek prompt medical evaluation, and
comply with exclusion from work until they are no longer deemed infectious to others.


If novel influenza virus A virus infection is suspected, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after symptom onset, especially for HCP with underlying medical conditions that may put them at increased risk for complications of influenza.




For asymptomatic HCP who have been judged to have had an unprotected exposure (e.g., within 2 meters of a symptomatic patient with novel influenza A virus infection without use of recommended respiratory protection and eye protection), exclude the provider from work until 10 days after their last exposure to monitor for signs and symptoms of respiratory illness.

If necessary to ensure adequate staffing of the facility, the asymptomatic healthcare worker could be considered for continuing work if they:










Have a negative influenza molecular assay result on upper respiratory tract specimens.







AND







Are started on post-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis within 2 days of the exposure







AND







Wear a facemask for source control. The facemask should be worn at all times while in the healthcare facility during a probable incubation period, e.g., 10 days after the exposure unless in a situation where a higher-level of respiratory protection is indicated (e.g., entering the room of a patient on Airborne Precautions). Antiviral chemoprophylaxis should continue for the duration of the potential incubation period.








Refer to the CDC web site for the most current recommendations on the use of antiviral agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza. Both HCP and patients should be reminded that persons treated with influenza antiviral medications continue to shed influenza virus while on treatment. Thus, hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette practices should continue while on treatment.


Facilities and organizations providing healthcare should:

Implement sick leave policies for HCP that are non-punitive, flexible and consistent with public health guidance (e.g., policies should allow and encourage HCP who may have infections due to agents covered by this guidance to stay home, unless hospital admission for isolation and treatment is recommended).
Ensure that all HCP encompassed by these policies are aware of the sick leave policies.
Provide employee health services consistent with those recommended in the Guideline for Infection Control in Healthcare Personnel and that:

Establish procedures for tracking absences and promptly identify HCP who may have infections due to agents covered by this guidance.
Ensure that HCP have ready access, including via telephone, to medical consultation and, if needed, prompt treatment.






	
		
			
			Train and Educate Healthcare Personnel
		
	
	
		Provide all HCP with job- or task-specific education and training on preventing transmission of infectious agents, including refresher training when an outbreak of respiratory disease is detected in the healthcare facility.

	
		
			
			Ensure Adherence to Infection Control Practices (i.e., Standard Precautions, plus Contact and Airborne Precautions)
		
	
	
		
HCP (see section 7 for measures for non-HCP visitors) who enter the room or care area of patients covered by this guidance with suspected or laboratory-confirmed novel influenza A virus infection should adhere to all of the following (follow recommended sequencepdf icon for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment):

Hand Hygiene

HCP should perform hand hygiene before and after all patient contact, contact with potentially infectious material, and before putting on and upon removal of personal protective equipment, including gloves. Alcohol-based hand rub is preferred for hand hygiene in healthcare settings; if hands are visibly soiled, use soap and water instead of alcohol-based hand rubs.
Healthcare facilities should ensure that facilities and supplies for performing hand hygiene are readily available to all personnel.


Gloves

Put on clean, non-sterile gloves upon entry into the patient room or care area. Change the gloves if they become torn or heavily contaminated.
Wear gloves whenever touching the patient’s intact skin or surfaces and articles in close proximity to the patient (e.g., medical equipment, bed rails, linens).
Remove and discard gloves immediately upon leaving the patient room or care area. Please see section below on “Using More than one Kind of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)” for recommended sequence of PPE removal.


Gowns

Put on a clean gown upon entry into the patient room or area. Change the gown if it becomes soiled. Remove and discard the gown immediately upon leaving the patient room or care area.


Respiratory Protection

Use respiratory protection (i.e., a respirator) that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-approved disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator upon entry to the patient room or care area. See appendix for respirator definition.
The respirator should be the last part of the personal protective equipment (PPE) ensemble to be removed. If reusable respirators are used, they must be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer’s reprocessing instructions prior to re-use. If disposable respirators are used, they should be removed and discarded after leaving the patient room or care area and closing the door.
Respirator use should be in the context of a complete respiratory protection program in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation. (29 CFR 1910.134external icon). Staff should be medically cleared, fit-tested if using respirators with tight-fitting facepieces (e.g., a NIOSH-approved disposable N95) and trained in the proper use of respirators, safe removal and disposal, and medical contraindications to respirator use.


Eye Protection

Put on eye protection (i.e., goggles or face shield) upon entry to the patient room or care area. Remove and discard eye protection immediately upon leaving the patient room or care area. If reusable eye protection is used, it must be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer’s reprocessing instructions prior to re-use.


Patient Placement

Place a patient who is confirmed or suspected to be infected with a novel influenza A virus associated with severe disease (e.g. probable or suspect case/case under investigation) in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) that has been constructed in accordance with current guidelines.
If an AIIR is not available, the patient should be transferred as soon as is feasible to a facility where an AIIR is available. Pending transfer, place a facemask on the patient and isolate him/her in an examination room with the door closed. The patient should not be placed in any room where room exhaust is recirculated without high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration.
Once in an AIIR, the patient’s facemask may be removed; the facemask should remain on if the patient is not in an AIIR. Limit transport and movement of the patient outside of the AIIR to medically essential purposes. When outside of the AIIR, patients should wear a facemask for source control.
Only essential personnel should enter the AIIR. Implement staffing policies to minimize the number of essential personnel who must enter the room.
In the event in which large numbers of patients require AIIR, consideration can be made to placing patients who are presumed to have the same infection together (cohorting).
Once the patient vacates a room, unprotected individuals, including HCP, should not be allowed in that room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. More information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available. In addition, the room should undergo appropriate cleaning and surface disinfection before unprotected individuals are allowed to reenter it. More informationpdf icon is available.


Use Caution When Performing Aerosol-Generating Procedures (AGPs)

Some procedures performed on patients covered in this guidance may be more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols. These procedures potentially put HCP and others at an increased risk for influenza exposure. There is neither expert consensus, nor sufficient supporting data, to create a definitive and comprehensive list of AGPs for healthcare settings.
Commonly performed medical procedures that are often considered AGPs, or that might create uncontrolled respiratory secretions, include:












open suctioning of airways
sputum induction
cardiopulmonary resuscitation
endotracheal intubation and extubation
non-invasive ventilation (e.g., BiPAP, CPAP)
bronchoscopy
manual ventilation


In general, these procedures should be limited to situations when they are medically necessary and cannot be postponed. When performing AGPs, limiting the number of HCP present during the procedure to only those essential for patient care and support is recommended.

Based on limited available data, it is uncertain whether aerosols generated from some procedures may be infectious, such as:

nebulizer administration*
high flow O2 delivery


*Aerosols generated by nebulizers are derived from medication in the nebulizer. It is uncertain whether potential associations between performing this common procedure and increased risk of infection might be due to aerosols generated by the procedure or due to increased contact between those administering the nebulized medication and infected patients.








	
		
			
			Implement Environmental Infection Control
		
	
	
		
Ensure that cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly.
Detailed information on environmental infection control in healthcare settings can be found in CDC’s Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities and Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings [section IV.F. Care of the environment].
Standard cleaning and disinfection procedures (e.g., using cleaners and water to preclean surfaces prior to applying disinfectants to frequently touched surfaces or objects for indicated contact times) are adequate for influenza virus environmental control in all settings within the healthcare facility, including those patient-care areas in which aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
Management of laundry and food service utensils should also be performed in accordance with standard procedures. There are no data suggesting these items are associated with influenza virus transmission when these items are properly managed.
Medical waste should be managed in accordance with requirements of the Department of Transportation. Some medical waste may be designated as regulated or biohazardous waste and require special handling and disposal methods approved by the State authorities.


	
		
			
			Manage Visitor Access and Movement Within the Facility
		
	
	
		
Establish procedures for monitoring, managing, and training visitors

Regardless of restriction policy, all visitors should follow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette precautions listed in the Take Steps to Minimize Potential Exposures section of the Prevention Strategies for Seasonal Influenza in Healthcare Settings.






For the safety of the visitor, in general, patients should be encouraged to limit in-person visitation while they are infectious. However, facilities should adhere to local, territorial, tribal, state, and federal regulations related to visitation.

Encourage use of alternative mechanisms for patient and visitor interactions such as video-call applications on cell phones or tablets, when appropriate.






For persons with acute respiratory symptoms, facilities should develop visitor restriction policies that consider location of patient being visited (e.g., oncology units) and circumstances, such as end-of-life situations, where exemptions to the restriction may be considered at the discretion of the facility.
Visits to patients in isolation should be controlled to allow for:

Screening visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness before entering the facility.
Facilities should provide instruction, before visitors enter the patient’s room, on hand hygiene, limiting surfaces touched, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) according to current facility policy while in the patient’s room.
Facilities should consider tracking (e.g., log book) all visitors who enter patient rooms.
Visitors should not be present during aerosol-generating procedures.
Visitors should be instructed to limit their movement within the facility.
Exposed visitors should be advised to report any signs and symptoms of acute illness to their health care provider for a period of at least 10 days after the last known exposure to the sick patient.




	
		
			
			Monitor Severe Respiratory Infections in the Healthcare Setting
		
	
	
		
Implement mechanisms and policies that promptly alert HCP about increased respiratory illness activity or outbreak within the facility.
Establish procedures to identify HCP at highest risk and actively follow them for acute respiratory illness, and to encourage all HCP to self-report acute respiratory illness.
Communicate and collaborate with public health authorities.


	
Appendix: Additional Information about Influenza
Information about Facemasks:

FDA – Masks and N95 Respirators, FDAexternal icon
A facemask is a product that covers the wearer’s nose and mouth. Facemasks are for use as source control and some may not be considered personal protective equipment. Facemasks may or may not meet any fluid barrier or filtration efficiency levels; therefore, they are not a substitute for N95 respirators or other filtering facepiece respirators, which provide respiratory protection to the wearer, or for surgical masks, which provide fluid barrier protection to the wearer.

Information about Respirators:

FDA – Surgical Masks and N95 Respirators, FDAexternal icon
A respirator is a personal protective device that is worn on the face, covers at least the nose and mouth, and is used to reduce the wearer’s risk of inhaling hazardous airborne particles (including dust particles and infectious agents), gases, or vapors. Respirators are approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). A commonly used respirator is a disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator (commonly referred to as an N95).
Surgical N95 respirators are NIOSH-approved disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators that also meet the FDA requirements for fluid penetration, flammability, and biocompatibility. Surgical N95 respirators are recommended for use by healthcare personnel who need protection from both airborne and fluid hazards, such as splashes or sprays.
Reusable respirators include elastomeric half facepiece respirators and powered air-purifying respirators.
To work properly, tight fitting respirators must be specially fitted for each person who wears one (this is called “fit-testing” and is usually done in a workplace where respirators are used).

This document briefly summarizes important clinical information related to avian influenza A viruses of public health concern and CDC’s recommendations for patient evaluation, treatment, and testing.
For complete guidance, go to:

Infection Control Within Healthcare Settings for Patients with Novel Influenza A Viruses.
Specimen Collection and Testing for Patients with Novel Influenza A Viruses with Potential to Cause Severe Disease in Humans.
Use of Antiviral Medications for Treatment of Human Infections with Novel Influenza A Viruses.

Background
Avian influenza A viruses circulate among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species to cause disease referred to as avian influenza. Some avian influenza A viruses cause high morbidity and mortality in infected poultry, while others cause no illness or only mild disease in poultry. Some avian influenza A viruses have caused rare, sporadic infections in people, resulting in human illness ranging from mild to severe respiratory disease. These avian influenza A viruses are of public health concern because they can cause infection resulting in illness in people and because of their pandemic potential if a virus acquires the ability for sustained human-to-human transmission. Some clusters of limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A viruses have been reported. People who are exposed to poultry or wild aquatic birds infected with avian influenza A viruses or associated contaminated environments may become infected with these viruses. People involved in poultry outbreak response activities and others with exposures to infected birds or contaminated material, surfaces, or water may be at risk of avian influenza A virus infection. CDC recommends that people with these exposures monitor their health for any signs and symptoms for 10 days after their exposure and to call their health department if they develop illness. Health departments may ask responders to seek care and/or testing for avian influenza A virus infection, including specific testing for avian influenza A viruses.
Summary Recommendations
Recommended actions for patients considered to have recent exposure to avian influenza A viruses.
If signs/symptoms compatible with avian influenza A virus infection are present:

Isolate patient and follow infection control recommendations below.
Initiate empiric antiviral treatment as soon as possible.
Notify state/local health department.
Collect respiratory specimens from the patient to test for avian influenza A viruses at the state health department.

 If signs/symptoms compatible with avian influenza A virus infection are not present:

Follow standard health care facility infection control practices/protocols.
Investigate other potential causes of the patient’s signs and symptoms.
Contact state/local health department with any questions or concerns.

Signs/Symptoms of avian influenza A virus infection in humans: Signs/symptoms may include uncomplicated upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms also referred to as influenza-like illness (ILI) [fever ?100°F plus cough or sore throat], fever (temperature of 100ºF [37.8ºC] or greater) or feeling feverish, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, eye redness (or conjunctivitis), shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Less common signs and symptoms are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or seizures. It is important to remember that infection with influenza viruses, including avian influenza A viruses, does not always cause fever. Fever may not occur in infected persons of any age, particularly in persons aged 65 years and older or people with immunosuppression. The absence of fever should not supersede clinical judgment when evaluating a patient for illness compatible with avian influenza A virus infection.
Infection prevention and control recommendations: Standard Precautions, plus Contact and Airborne Precautions, including the use of eye protection, are recommended when evaluating patients for infection with avian influenza A viruses. If an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) is not available, isolate the patient in a private room. Health care personnel should wear recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when providing patient care. These recommendations are consistent with existing infection control guidance for care of patients who might be infected with a novel influenza A virus associated with severe disease. For more information on recommended infection prevention and control measures, please visit Infection Control Within Healthcare Settings for Patients with Novel Influenza A Viruses.
Laboratory testing recommendations: If signs or symptoms consistent with infection with avian influenza A virus are present in a patient with recent exposure to infected birds or contaminated environments, respiratory specimens should be collected for molecular testing (RT-PCR) for influenza viruses, including avian influenza A viruses. For outpatients, upper respiratory tract specimens should be collected. If conjunctivitis is present, conjunctival swabs should be collected. Patients who are severely ill should have both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens collected for influenza testing. For information on specimen collection, infection prevention and control recommendations when collecting specimens, and influenza diagnostic testing, please visit Specimen Collection and Testing for Patients with Novel Influenza A Viruses with Potential to Cause Severe Disease in Humans. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are not a reliable indicator of avian influenza A virus infection, and the results should not be used to guide infection control or antiviral treatment decisions. Both commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests and most influenza molecular assays do not distinguish between infection with seasonal influenza A viruses and avian influenza A viruses. Testing for avian influenza A viruses must be performed at state health department laboratories, and CDC. Testing for other potential causes of acute respiratory illness should also be considered depending upon the local epidemiology of circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. 
Treatment recommendations: Initiation of antiviral treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor is recommended as soon as possible for any patient with suspected or confirmed infection with an avian influenza A virus. This includes patients who are confirmed cases, probable cases, or cases under investigation, even if more than 48 hours has elapsed since illness onset and regardless of illness severity (outpatients or hospitalized patients). Treatment with oral or enterically administered oseltamivir (twice daily x 5 days) is recommended regardless of time since onset of symptoms. If the patient has been sick for 2 days or less, oral baloxavir treatment is an option. Antiviral treatment should not be delayed while waiting for laboratory test results. If molecular testing is negative for novel avian influenza A virus infection and other influenza viruses, but influenza virus infection is still suspected in a patient who is severely ill, antiviral treatment should be continued and additional respiratory specimens should be collected for repeat influenza testing. For patients who are not hospitalized, if molecular testing is negative for avian influenza A virus and other influenza viruses, antiviral treatment can be discontinued. For more information on treatment recommendations, please visit Use of Antiviral Medications for Treatment of Human Infections with Novel Influenza A Viruses.

Avian Influenza Guidance

Avian influenza A virus infections in humans are of public health concern, not only because of the illness they might cause, but because of their pandemic potential if they were to change to spread easily from person-to-person. Avian influenza A virus infections can cause a wide range of illness, from mild to severe. Some avian influenza A viruses have been associated with greater numbers of human infections and more serious illnesses in people and therefore may pose a greater public health risk.

Background
This document provides interim guidance for clinicians and public health professionals in the United States on antiviral chemoprophylaxis of persons exposed to birds infected with avian influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease or thought to have the potential to cause severe human disease. Examples of viruses with the potential to cause severe human disease can be found on Bird Flu Virus Infections in Humans. Additionally, more information about specific avian influenza A viruses and past reported human infections with avian influenza A viruses is available. There is limited experience with these newly detected viruses to inform public health guidance regarding use of antiviral chemoprophylaxis. However, these viruses are thought to have the potential to infect people and cause severe illness.  A small number of rare human infections with avian influenza A viruses have been documented in the U.S. since 2002. CDC will update this guidance as additional information becomes available.
Exposure to Birds Infected with Avian Influenza
Persons with recent exposure (within 10 days) to avian influenza A viruses include the following:

Exposure to A(H5), A(H7), or A(H9) virus infected birds is defined as follows:

Close exposure (within 2 meters) to birds, with confirmed avian influenza A virus infection by A(H5), A(H7), or A(H9) viruses. Bird exposures can include, but are not limited to handling, slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, culling, or preparation of birds for consumption; OR
Direct contact with surfaces contaminated with feces or bird parts (e.g., carcasses, internal organs) from infected birds; OR
Visiting a live poultry market with confirmed bird infections or associated with a case of human infection with avian influenza A virus.


Exposure to an infected person – Close (within 2 meters) unprotected (without use of respiratory and eye protection) exposure to a person who is a confirmed, probable, or symptomatic suspected case of human infection with avian influenza A virus (e.g. in a household or healthcare facility).
Laboratory exposure – Unprotected (without use of respiratory and eye protection) exposure to avian influenza A virus in a laboratory.

More information can be found on Case Definitions for Investigations of Human Infection with Avian Influenza A Viruses in the United States.
Infected refers to infection with avian influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease or which have the potential to cause severe human disease. The risk of infection with avian influenza A viruses is higher in people with unprotected exposures (e.g., not using respiratory and eye protection) than in those who used such protective equipment.
 Top of Page
Exposure to Wild Birds with Unknown Avian Influenza A Virus Infection Status
Persons with unprotected exposure (e.g., not using respiratory and eye protection) are included in the definition above and on Case Definitions for Investigations of Human Infection with Avian Influenza A Viruses in the United States.
It is not possible to know whether a well-appearing, sick or dead wild bird is infected with avian influenza A viruses until they are tested.
Information for People Exposed to Birds Infected with Avian Influenza Viruses of Public Health Concern
Information Specific to Hunters of Wild Waterfowl [296 KB, 2 pages]
Monitoring of Exposed Persons
Exposed persons should monitor themselves daily for signs and symptoms of new illness for 10 days after the last known exposure. Signs and symptoms may include fever (temperature of 100ºF [37.8ºC] or greater) or feeling feverish, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, eye redness (or conjunctivitis), shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Fever may not always be present. Less common signs and symptoms are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or seizures.
Any exposed person who has any new illness symptoms, particularly fever or feeling feverish or any respiratory symptoms should be referred for prompt medical evaluation, antiviral treatment, and testing for avian influenza A virus infection.
Post-exposure Chemoprophylaxis of Exposed Persons
Chemoprophylaxis with influenza antiviral medications can be considered for exposed persons. Decisions to initiate post-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be based on clinical judgment, with consideration given to the type of exposure (e.g. without use of respiratory and eye protection), duration of exposure, time since exposure (e.g. less than 2 days), known infection status of the birds the person was exposed to, and to whether the exposed person is at higher risk for complications from seasonal influenza.
If post-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis is initiated, treatment dosing for the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamivir (one dose twice daily) is recommended in these instances instead of the typical antiviral chemoprophylaxis regimen (once daily).4 For specific dosage recommendations for treatment by age group, please see Influenza Antiviral Medications: Summary for Clinicians. Physicians should consult the manufacturer’s package insert for dosing, limitations of populations studied, contraindications, and adverse effects. If exposure was time-limited and not ongoing, the recommended duration is five days (one dose twice daily), from the last known exposure. Chemoprophylaxis is not routinely recommended for personnel involved in culling non-infected or likely non-infected bird populations as a control measure for personnel involved in handling sick birds or decontaminating affected environments (including animal disposal) who used proper personal protective equipment.

Footnotes
1 The highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses isolated from US wild aquatic birds and domestic poultry is genetically different from the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses that have caused sporadic human infections resulting in severe illness with high mortality in several other countries (notably in Asia and Africa).
2 This direct exposure may include: contact with birds (e.g., handling, slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, preparation for consumption); direct contact with surfaces contaminated with feces or bird parts (carcasses, internal organs, etc.); or prolonged exposure to birds.
3 The potential incubation period is unknown for avian influenza A viruses which are not yet known to cause human disease. Available data suggest that the estimated incubation period for human infection with A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses is generally 3 to 5 days but has been reported to be as long as 7-10 days.
4 This recommendation for twice daily antiviral chemoprophylaxis dosing frequency is based on limited data that support higher chemoprophylaxis dosing in animals for avian A(H5N1) virus (Boltz DA, et al JID 2008;197:1315) and the desire to reduce the potential for development of resistance while receiving once daily dosing (Baz M, et al NEJM 2009;361:2296; Cane A et al PIDJ 2010;29:384; MMWR 2009;58:969).

This document provides guidance for follow-up and antiviral chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of cases of human infection with novel influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease or with the potential to cause severe human disease.
This interim guidance is based on expert opinion and currently available published and unpublished data for antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis of seasonal, pandemic, and novel influenza A virus infections. These recommendations are based on the following considerations:

Novel influenza A viruses have caused sporadic infections resulting in severe human disease and substantial mortality among detected cases to date.
Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of some novel influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease likely occurred or cannot be excluded in some case clusters that have occurred worldwide.
Sufficient supplies of antiviral agents that are expected to be effective against novel influenza A viruses are available.

The public health goal of this interim guidance is to prevent further spread of novel influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease if there are infected persons in the United States. It is specific to a scenario where there are sporadic cases associated with infected domestic poultry or wild bird exposures, and there is concern for possible limited, non-sustained human-to-human virus transmission.
Definition of Close Contacts
Close contacts are defined as persons within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) or within the room or care area of a confirmed or probable novel influenza A case-patient for a prolonged period of time, or who had direct contact with infectious secretions while the case-patient was likely to be infectious (beginning 1 day prior to illness onset and continuing until resolution of illness). 2
In general, decisions to initiate antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be guided by the risk stratification described below,3 based on observational data for reported cases of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) and A(H5N1) viruses, and on data from seasonal influenza studies. The risk of infection following close contact with a confirmed or probable novel influenza A case-patient is higher for persons with prolonged, unprotected exposures (e.g., without use of respiratory and eye protection) than for close contacts (e.g., health care personnel) who were wearing recommended personal protective equipment. More information: Recommended Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) [2.9 MB, 3 pages] and Interim Guidance for Infection Control Within Healthcare Settings.



Highest-risk exposure groups (recognized risk of transmission)

Household or close family member contacts with unprotected, prolonged close contact to a confirmed or probable case.


Moderate-risk exposure groups (unknown risk of transmission)

Health care personnel with unprotected close contact with a confirmed or probable case or nonhousehold members with prolonged unprotected close contact with a confirmed or probable case outside of a healthcare facility.


Low-risk exposure groups (transmission unlikely)

Others who have had social contact of a short duration with a confirmed or probable case in a non-hospital setting (e.g., in a community or workplace environment)4.





Health care personnel with unprotected close contact to case-patients with novel influenza A virus infection may have higher risk exposures than others through caring for patients of greater illness severity and higher viral levels. Persons with prolonged unprotected exposures outside of a healthcare facility may have a higher risk of exposure than those with short duration of close contact with a mildly ill novel influenza case-patient. Persons with an unprotected exposure to novel influenza A virus associated with severe human disease in a laboratory setting may have a high-risk or moderate-risk exposure, and need to be evaluated case by case.
Follow-up of Close Contacts of a Novel Influenza A Case-Patient
Public health personnel should attempt to identify as soon as possible and monitor all close contacts of confirmed or probable cases of human infection with novel influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease for new illness. (Visit Avian Influenza A Virus Case Definitions.) Available data suggest that the estimated incubation period for human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses is generally 3 to 5 days, but has been reported to be 7-10 days [1-12]. Limited non-sustained person-to-person transmission of A(H7N9) virus could not be excluded in some family clusters [7]. Limited non-sustained person-to-person transmission of A(H5N1) virus has been reported in several countries following close, prolonged unprotected contact with a severely ill A(H5N1) patient, including in household and hospital settings [6, 10, 11].
Identified close contacts should be monitored daily for 10 days after the last known exposure to a confirmed or probable case. Measured temperature and presence of respiratory symptoms should be assessed daily during this period. Any close contacts of a confirmed or probable case with a measured temperature of ?38.0°C (?100.4°F) or any new respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing) should be referred for prompt medical evaluation and testing for novel influenza A virus infection. To facilitate investigation, and if resources are available, close contacts of cases under investigation (especially those with a high index of suspicion) also may be identified and monitored for fever and respiratory symptoms while the results of laboratory testing are pending.
Post-exposure Antiviral Chemoprophylaxis of Asymptomatic Close Contacts

Oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir chemoprophylaxis should be provided to close contacts of a confirmed or probable novel influenza A case-patient according to risk of exposure.

In highest-risk exposure groups, chemoprophylaxis should be administered.
In moderate-risk exposure groups, chemoprophylaxis could be considered.
In low-risk exposure groups, chemoprophylaxis is not routinely recommended.


Decisions to initiate antiviral chemoprophylaxis for persons in moderate- and low-risk exposure groups should be based on clinical judgment, with consideration given to the type of exposure and to whether the close contact is at higher risk for complications from influenza (visit Influenza Antiviral Medications: Summary for Clinicians).
Administration of antiviral chemoprophylaxis should begin as soon as possible (within 48 hours) after the first exposure to the confirmed or probable case.
The treatment frequency dosing for oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir (one dose twice daily) is recommended instead of the typical antiviral chemoprophylaxis regimen (once daily). For specific dosage recommendations for treatment by age group, please visit Recommended Dosage and Duration of Influenza Antiviral Medications for Treatment or Chemoprophylaxis and refer to the treatment dosing (twice daily) as provided for seasonal influenza.

This recommendation for twice daily antiviral chemoprophylaxis dosing frequency is based on limited data that support higher chemoprophylaxis dosing in animals for avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection [13], and on the desire to reduce the potential for development of antiviral resistance while receiving once daily chemoprophylaxis [14-16].


Antiviral chemoprophylaxis with treatment frequency dosing (twice daily) of oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir should be continued for 5 or 10 days. If the exposure was time-limited and not ongoing, the recommended duration is 5 days from the last known exposure. If the exposure is likely to be ongoing (e.g., household setting), a duration of 10 days is recommended because of the potential for prolonged infectiousness from the novel influenza A case-patient.
Oral oseltamivir is recommended for persons of any age including newborn infants; inhaled zanamivir for persons aged 7 years and older.5 Inhaled zanamivir is not recommended for persons with underlying airway disease (e.g., asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Physicians should consult the manufacturer’s package insert for dosing, limitations of populations studied, contraindications, and adverse effects.

Antiviral Treatment of Symptomatic Close Contacts (Cases under Investigation)

Symptomatic close contacts with any illness symptoms should be promptly tested for novel influenza A virus infection (visit Interim Guidance for Specimen Collection, Processing, and Testing for Patients with Suspected Infection with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Disease in Humans) and simultaneously treated as soon as possible with a neuraminidase inhibitor medication (oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or intravenous (IV) peramivir) or oral baloxavir if within 2 days of symptom onset. If >2 days from symptom onset has occurred, treatment with oral oseltamivir should be started as soon as possible. (Visit the Interim Guidance on the Use of Antiviral Medications for Treatment of Human Infections with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Human Disease.)
Symptomatic persons should be isolated at home except to seek medical care and advised to avoid contact with other persons until their illness is resolved.

New Symptoms after Use of an Antiviral Agent

If a close contact becomes symptomatic or has worsening of symptoms after or during use of an antiviral agent, contact with other persons should be minimized, appropriate infection prevention and control measures should be used in healthcare settings (visit Interim Guidance for Infection Control Within Healthcare Settings When Caring for Patients with Confirmed Cases, Probable Cases, and Cases Under Investigation for Infection with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Disease), and respiratory specimens should be collected for novel influenza A virus testing at the state health department as soon as possible.
If a close contact tests positive for an avian influenza A virus associated with severe disease in humans (e.g., A(H5N1), A(H5N6) or A(H7N9) virus) and had taken oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis for 3 or more days before becoming symptomatic [17], oseltamivir should be stopped as soon as treatment with inhaled zanamivir (twice daily) or oral baloxavir can be initiated. This is because some novel influenza A viruses may rapidly become oseltamivir-resistant (and potentially peramivir-resistant) and remain zanamivir-susceptible and baloxavir-susceptible.
Investigation for antiviral resistance should be initiated immediately (in conjunction with the CDC Influenza Division), and infection prevention and control measures recommended for patients with novel influenza A virus infection should be implemented. (Visit Interim Guidance for Infection Control Within Healthcare Settings When Caring for Confirmed Cases, Probable Cases, and Cases Under Investigation for Infection with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Disease.)
Questions regarding arranging testing for antiviral resistance, or regarding appropriate clinical management if antiviral resistance is a concern, should be directed to the CDC Influenza Division via the CDC Emergency Operations Center (770-488-7100).

CDC will provide updated information as it becomes available on the CDC website at the Avian Influenza Current Situation Summary and Avian Influenza: Information for Health Professionals and Laboratorians.

Influenza viruses are constantly changing, and thus require continued vigilance to protect the United States and the rest of the world not only from seasonal influenza but also from novel influenza A viruses that could trigger a pandemic. Global influenza surveillance, both epidemiologic and virologic, is the foundation of influenza preparedness and response for influenza viruses, including avian influenza viruses.
This work is conducted through the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)external icon which was established in 1952. The GISRS network consists of national influenza centers (NICS) which conduct influenza virus surveillance and study influenza disease trends. There also are a number of designated WHO Collaborating Centers (CCs) that conduct further research and analysis on information and samples gathered by the NICS.
CDC’s Influenza Division  is the U.S. lead for influenza surveillance and has served as a WHO CC for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza since 1956. It is the largest global resource and reference center supporting public health interventions to control and prevent seasonal and pandemic influenza. Internationally, CDC also plays an important role in helping to establish, maintain and expand influenza surveillance and laboratory capacity in more than 50 countries around the world through the CDC Influenza Division International Program.

Because of the possible threat bird flu viruses pose to human health, CDC conducts research to learn more about these viruses, for example, where they spread, how they spread, and what kinds of disease they cause. This includes antigenic characterization, antiviral resistance, genetic characterization, serology and assessment of bird flu viruses’ ability to cause disease and spread in animal models. This information, coupled with disease surveillance information, can help scientists better understand the risk these viruses pose to human health.

What agents, toxins and categories of research experiments fall under the category of “DURC?”
There are 15 select agents and toxinsexternal icon and seven categories of experiments on these select agents that fall under the subset of research called DURC. These agents and toxins include the following:

Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses
Bacillus anthracis (anthrax),
Botulinum neurotoxin,
Burkholderia mallei,
Burkholderia pseudomallei,
Ebola virus,
Foot-and-mouth disease virus,
Francisella tularensis,
Marburg virus,
Reconstructed 1918 influenza virus,
Rinderpest virus,
Toxin-producing strains of clostridium botulinum,
Variola major (smallpox)
Variola minor viruses (smallpox),
and Yersinia pestis.

Categories of research experiments that fall under DURC include those that do the following:

enhance the harmful consequences of the agent or toxin;
disrupt immunity or the effectiveness of an immunization against the agent or toxin without clinical and/or agricultural justification;
confer to the agent or toxin resistance to clinically and/or agricultural useful preventative or treatment interventions against that agent or toxin or facilitates their ability to evade methods of detection;
increase the stability, transmissibility, or the ability to disseminate the agent or toxin;
alters the host range or tropism of the agent or toxin
enhance the susceptibility of a host population to the agent or toxin
generate or reconstitute an eradicated or extinct agent or one of the 15 DURC toxins or agents

 Top of Page
Why are highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses considered a select agent?
Select agents are biological agents and toxins that have been determined to have the potential to pose a severe threat to human or animal health, to plant health, or to animal and plant products. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses are “agricultural select agents” because of the danger they pose to animal health, for example, U.S. poultry. HPAI viruses are not considered select agents because of the danger they pose to human health. Although human infections with certain HPAI viruses, such as Asian A(H5Nx) and A(H7Nx), can lead to severe illness and death, human infections with these viruses are generally rare, and HPAI viruses currently do not spread easily from birds to humans or between humans.
What was the voluntary moratorium on laboratory research specific to the highly pathogenic A(H5N1) bird flu virus and what is the government’s current stance on this research?
On January 20, 2012, a voluntary moratorium on laboratory research specific to the highly pathogenic A(H5N1) bird flu virus was announced in a letter signed by 39 international flu researchers. This moratorium, which was initially expected to last 60 days, was not lifted until January 23, 2013, due to the controversy surrounding the topic. This moratorium prompted the development of the U.S. Government’s DURC policyexternal icon, which was launched in March 2012. In October 2014, following publication of several controversial “gain of function” (GOF) studies as well as several high-profile incidents in U.S. biocontainment laboratories, the U.S. Government introduced another moratorium on all U.S. funded GOF research on certain “potential pandemic pathogens” (PPPs)pdf iconexternal icon, including influenza viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) viruses.  On December 19, 2017, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lifted this 3-year moratorium. The lifting of this moratorium allows certain types of U.S. government funded laboratory research studies involving these pathogens to resume. The types of studies that now can be conducted are governed by the HHS frameworkpdf iconexternal icon for guiding funding decisions about research involving enhanced potential pandemic pathogens, also known as the “HHS P3CO Framework,” which also was released on December 19, 2017.
What is the HHS P3CO Framework and what kinds of research does it provide guidance for?
On December 19, 2017, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) launched a new frameworkpdf iconexternal icon called the “Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (PPP).”  HHS maintains a group of subject matter and policy experts for PPP care and oversight (P3CO). This framework is intended to guide HHS funding decisions on individual proposed research that is reasonably anticipated to create, transfer, or use enhanced PPPspdf iconexternal icon. The HHS P3CO framework is responsive to and in accordance with the “Recommended Policy Guidance for Departmental Development of Review Mechanisms for Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversightexternal icon” issued on January 9, 2017, and it supercedes a prior framework called the “Framework for Guiding Department of Health and Human Services Funding Decisions about Research Proposals with the Potential for Generating Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 viruses that are Transmissible among Mammals by Respiratory Droplets.” The HHS P3CO Framework ensures a multidisciplinary, department-level pre-funding review and evaluation of proposed research meeting the scope outlined in the document to help inform funding agency decisions. It strives to obtain the benefits of life sciences research while minimizing potential biosafety and biosecurity risks.
The HHS P3CO framework states that research involving PPPs is essential to protecting global health and security; however, it acknowledges that there are biosecurity risks associated with undertaking such research that must be adequately considered and appropriately mitigated in order to help safely realize the potential benefits.
The HHS P3CO Framework explains its scope and its definitions in an online PDFpdf iconexternal icon.
What is “gain of function (GOF)” bird flu research?
Gain of function research is research that seeks to alter the functional characteristics of a virus. Examples of gain of function research include research that seeks to produce mutations in a virus that could allow it to become more transmissible, infect a wider range of hosts, increase its disease severity, or confer resistance to existing drugs, treatments or vaccines.
What is the public health justification for engaging in bird flu research that falls into the categories of DURC, GOF or enhanced PPP?
Knowledge gained from DURC, GOF, and enhanced PPP studies offers many benefits to the public. These studies support public health risk assessments that are essential to prioritize the development of infection control and intervention strategies such as antiviral drug treatment and vaccination and are essential to improve our readiness before nature produces the next pandemic virus.
A primary purpose of this type of research is to identify genetic sequences that exist or may emerge in flu viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic. Information from these studies is critical to the implementation of effective global surveillance strategies so that high-risk genetic signatures can be quickly identified in emerging viruses, providing early warning of a pandemic threat.
DURC, GOF, and enhanced PPP studies are also essential to identify and confirm that a given mutation confers a functional change to the flu virus. Understanding the functional mechanisms affected by key genetic sequences offers the opportunity to exploit viral processes for antiviral drug development. Flu viruses evolve quickly and have the potential to acquire resistance to currently available antiviral drugs, which would leave clinicians with limited options to treat patients.
The best way to control flu virus infections is by vaccination using safe and effective vaccines. Current flu vaccine development requires a substantial lag time between when a virus is first identified and when a vaccine can be manufactured and distributed to the public. Proponents of GOF research hope to overcome the time constraints of vaccine production by preparing and manufacturing flu vaccines in advance before they emerge in nature. GOF research is necessary to know which genetic characteristics to include in vaccines for optimal shelf life and effectiveness for prevention of infection and disease caused by the flu virus.
Is CDC conducting any DURC or enhanced PPP research on bird flu viruses?
During the period of the moratorium, CDC did not conduct DURC research on highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. At this time, CDC is evaluating the need to conduct DURC and/or enhanced PPP studies on a case by case basis. Before CDC conducts studies on HPAI viruses, regardless of whether they fall into the DURC or enhanced PPP categories, a proposal for conducting the studies is first submitted to CDC’s Institutional Biosecurity Board (IBB). The IBB determines whether the study falls into the category of DURC or enhanced PPP or not. If the IBB determines that the proposed laboratory study falls into the category of DURC and potentially enhanced PPP, it will determine if additional HHS P3CO review is required before the study can be conducted. CDC’s research involving HPAI is conducted to inform risk assessments of novel flu viruses.
Does CDC currently conduct gain of function research on bird flu viruses?
During the period of the moratorium, CDC did not conduct “gain of function” research on bird flu viruses.  Now that the moratorium has been lifted, CDC will determine whether to conduct “gain of function” research on bird flu viruses on a case by case basis. See the question entitled “Is CDC conducting any DURC or enhanced PPP research on bird flu viruses?” for a basic description of this process. Proposals for studies potentially involving “gain of function” research must first be approved by CDC’s internal IBB, which will determine if the studies warrant further review by the HHS P3CO frameworkpdf iconexternal icon. This review process will determine whether the research is safe to conduct, whether it should be conducted, and what biosafety precautions and practices are required to conduct the work.
Has CDC done “gain of function” research on highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) in the past?
Yes. CDC has conducted “gain of function” research in the past on HPAI viruses as part of pandemic preparedness efforts. For example, in 2006 CDC conducted an experiment that sought to understand how Asian A(H5N1) bird flu viruses might become more transmissible in mammals (1). The study assessed the ability of highly pathogenic Asian A(H5N1) bird flu viruses to mix with human flu viruses through a process called “reassortment” that can occur in nature. Reassortment can result in the creation of new flu viruses with pandemic potential. This work was performed in BSL-3 enhanced laboratory facilities. Although CDC researchers were able to successfully create new flu viruses that shared genes from both Asian A(H5N1) bird flu and human flu viruses, the resulting viruses appeared to lack the molecular and biologic properties needed for efficient spread. The results suggested that these A(H5N1) bird flu viruses required further genetic change to gain the properties needed to cause a human pandemic.
A similar study was conducted in 2009 that conducted a health risk assessment of the ability of human seasonal A(H3N2) flu viruses to mix with certain A(H5N1) bird flu viruses in a laboratory setting (2). This study concluded that continued exposure of humans and animals to both A(H5N1) bird flu viruses and A(H3N2) seasonal viruses increased the risk of producing new H5 viruses that could produce infectious secretions in the upper airways of mammals.
Other CDC GOF studies on Asian A(H5N1) viruses included looking at how mutations to the surface proteins of the virus could affect the “receptor binding preference” of these viruses (3). The receptor binding preference determines the hosts that a flu virus is best suited to infecting, such as birds as opposed to mammals. Results from this study found that mutations that changed the receptor binding preference from birds to humans also tended to reduce the virus’ ability to replicate (i.e., make copies of itself for the purpose of spreading infection.) The authors concluded that alternative molecular changes would be needed for these A(H5N1) viruses to fully adapt to humans and be capable of causing a pandemic.
Another such study examined in a laboratory environment evolutionary changes that would need to occur for the receptor binding preference of specific Asian A(H5N1) viruses to change so that they would be better suited to infecting and causing illness in people as opposed to birds (4). This study concluded that extensive evolution of existing A(H5N1) viruses at that time would need to occur before these they could become fully transmissible in humans. Other scientists have conducted gain-of-function research on Asian A(H5N1) viruses and identified molecular changes that increase the ability of those viruses to transmit in mammals via infectious respiratory droplets.
