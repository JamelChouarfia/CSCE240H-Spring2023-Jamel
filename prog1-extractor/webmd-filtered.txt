However, casual contact does not seem to be involved.Various strains of bird flu pop up in U.S. poultry from time to time. When they do, all affected poultry flocks are culled.For example, in 2004, a highly dangerous bird flu strain appeared in a Texas chicken flock. The outbreak involved an H5N2 virus (not the H5N1 bird flu). By April 2004, the outbreak had been eradicated. No human infections were detected.The bird flu virus, avian influenza A, is divided into two main categories:Both versions can spread quickly through bird flocks and may cause serious illness in humans. This is important because birds infected with LPAI viruses may show little or no sign of disease as it spreads to animals or humans.Viruses often change over time, leading to different subtypes called strains. When bird flu infects humans, which is rare, it's most often from strains known as H5, H7, and H9. Less commonly, researchers have detected H10N8, H10N7, and H6N8 strains in humans.Yes, but you can't make an appointment to get it.
