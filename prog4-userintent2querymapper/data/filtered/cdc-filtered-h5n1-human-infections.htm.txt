Because human infection with avian influenza A virus poses pandemic potential, every case must be investigated to assess whether human-to-human transmission might have occurred. Detailed public health investigations can help determine whether person-to-person spread of an avian influenza A virus occurred. In some clusters of epidemiologically related cases of avian influenza A virus infection, limited, non-sustained, human-to-human transmission is thought to have occurred to persons without poultry exposures. No instances of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A viruses have been reported in the United States. Below are examples of probable limited, non-sustained, human-to-human transmission of different avian influenza A viruses in other countries.
Examples of probable person-to-person spread of avian influenza A viruses:
