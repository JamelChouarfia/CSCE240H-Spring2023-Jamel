Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) Asian (H5N1) viruses have evolved rapidly since they were first identified in humans in 1997. Because H5N1 viruses are always changing, CDC and other public health agencies look for genetic changes in H5N1 viruses that may impact how the viruses spread from person to person or their susceptibility to influenza antiviral drugs. To support international surveillance and pandemic preparedness efforts for avian influenza A H5N1 viruses, CDC has compiled an inventory of known H5N1 genetic changes.
