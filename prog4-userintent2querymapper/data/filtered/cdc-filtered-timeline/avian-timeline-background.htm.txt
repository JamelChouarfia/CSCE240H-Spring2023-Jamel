This page provides a brief background, timeline, and summary of significant past outbreaks of bird flu in wild birds, domestic poultry, and people. 
Flu A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 18 different HA subtypes (H1 through H18) and 11 different NA subtypes (N1 through N11).
Background
The first description of avian influenza (bird flu) dates to 1878 in northern Italy, when it was described as a contagious disease of poultry associated with high mortality, referred to as fowl plague.' At the turn of the 20 century, it was determined that fowl plague' was caused by a virus; however, it was not until 1955 that the virus was shown to be a type A influenza virus. In 1971, influenza viruses were first classified based on the antigenic properties of their structural and surface proteins: the nucleoprotein (NP) [type] and hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [subtype] proteins, as well as the species of origin. By 1980, researchers were using this system to classify influenza viruses regardless of the species of origin. This naming tradition is still used today. By 1981, the term fowl plague' was substituted by the more appropriate term, avian influenza, at the First International Symposium on Avian Influenza.
Flu virus surface proteins (HA and NA) can change in two ways. These changes are referred to as antigenic drift and shift. Flu viruses change all the time due to antigenic drift, but antigenic shift happens less frequently.
