If you see any sign of illness in your birds, immediately report it to your state veterinarian or the U.S. Department of Agriculture (1-866-536-7593).
If birds in your flock have avian (bird) influenza (flu) A virus infection, or you suspect they might, take the following actions to protect yourself:
Once bird flu infection is confirmed within a flock and premises, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) recommends that backyard owners continue to wear PPE when in contaminated areas until there are no longer infected birds, eggs, feces, or contaminated litter on the property. The recommendation to wear PPE when in contaminated areas (primary poultry housing: coops, runs, barns, etc.) depends on whether a 150-day fallow is used for virus elimination after flock depopulation.
USDA has information on cleaning and disinfecting or fallowing of premises that were contaminated with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and information on good biosecurity practices:
Put on PPE before you go into the coop or poultry environment. Do not wear or store PPE in your home after it has been worn in your coop and before it has been cleaned and disinfected. Put on and take off PPE in separate clean areas, if possible.
You can buy these items online or at many retail, hardware, or feed stores.
