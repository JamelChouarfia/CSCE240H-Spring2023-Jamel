Because of the possible threat bird flu viruses pose to human health, CDC conducts research to learn more about these viruses, for example, where they spread, how they spread, and what kinds of disease they cause. This includes antigenic characterization, antiviral resistance, genetic characterization, serology and assessment of bird flu viruses' ability to cause disease and spread in animal models. This information, coupled with disease surveillance information, can help scientists better understand the risk these viruses pose to human health.
