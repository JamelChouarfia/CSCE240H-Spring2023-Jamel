Around the world and in North America, avian influenza A outbreaks occur in poultry from time to time. Outbreaks of some avian influenza A viruses in poultry have been associated with illness and death in people in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East. While very rare, some avian influenza A viruses have also caused illness in people in North America.
